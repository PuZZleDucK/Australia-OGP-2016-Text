The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce the

Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the collaborative
spirit of the OGP.
The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely competitive
field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public engagement with Australia’s

of fields relevant to open government, and represent a diverse range of
interests and sectors.

      Council of Australia and has also previously served as the President of

      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience
      working with government, corporate and non-government sectors. The Law

Thank you once again to everyone who submitted an expression of interest. The

stakeholders as they work to co-draft Australia’s first National Action Plan.
We invite you to sign_up to the mailing list for updates, and stay tuned to
this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.
