4.2 – National Integrity Framework {#national-integrity-framework .entry-title}
==================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will collaborate with the corporate sector, non-government
organisations and the public to strengthen our national anti-corruption
and integrity framework.*

**Objective\
**Australia will strengthen our ability to prevent, detect and respond
to bribery and corruption. As part of this, we will regularly review the
jurisdiction and capabilities of the Australian Commission for Law
Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) and the Australian Federal Police’s Fraud
and Anti-Corruption Centre to ensure they can focus on protecting
Commonwealth agencies from risks of corruption.

**Status Quo\
**The Government takes a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to
combating corruption, under which a range of agencies play a role in
preventing, detecting and responding to corruption. We have strong laws
applying to bribery and corruption which carry significant penalties.

ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious
issues of corruption in agencies within its jurisdiction. ACLEI’s
jurisdiction focusses on protecting environments that are most at risk
of criminal compromise—namely, border regulation and law enforcement.

The Integrity Commissioner considers the nature and scope of corruption
revealed by investigations, and reports annually on any patterns and
trends in corruption in Australian Government law enforcement and other
government agencies which have law enforcement functions. Accordingly,
ACLEI collects intelligence about corruption in support of the Integrity
Commissioner’s functions.

ACLEI also aims to understand corruption and prevent it. Where the
Integrity Commissioner identifies laws of the Commonwealth or
administrative practices of government agencies that might contribute to
corrupt practices or prevent their early detection, he or she may make
recommendations for these laws or practices to be changed.

As a practitioner agency, ACLEI engages actively with other government
agencies and civil society (nationally and internationally) to collect
and share information to strengthen anti-corruption arrangements in
Australia and abroad. ACLEI’s dissemination program of Information
Reports is one means by which the Integrity Commissioner transmits
timely intelligence to relevant agencies, such as to police and other
integrity agencies. ACLEI and the AFP Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre
(FACC) also cross-refer information to one another, and assist one
another with corruption prevention activities.

In 2014, the Government established the FACC located in the AFP
headquarters to bring together a range of Commonwealth agencies to
assess, prioritise and respond to serious fraud and corruption matters,
including across Commonwealth services, programs and employees. The FACC
draws on the collective knowledge of agencies to provide sound
contemporary advice in relation to potential fraud threats relevant to
new government funding initiatives prior to their implementation. In
April 2016, the Government provided an additional \$15 million to the
FACC to enhance its capacity to detect and investigate corruption,
bribery and serious economic crime.

Between the FACC and ACLEI, there is significant coverage of fraud and
corruption across Australian Government agencies, with a particular
focus on areas of high-corruption risk.

The Government has reviewed ACLEI’s jurisdiction on a number of
occasions in the past and extended its jurisdiction where a need was
demonstrated.

In May 2016, the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law
Enforcement Integrity reported on its inquiry into ACLEI’s jurisdiction.
Many public submissions have advocated extension of its coverage to the
entire public sector. The Committee recommended the Government extend
ACLEI’s jurisdiction to include the entire Department of Agriculture and
Water Resources, and examine the feasibility of including the Australian
Taxation Office within ACLEI’s jurisdiction. The Government is
considering the report’s recommendations.

The Government is also exploring new responses to corruption and
corporate crime. In March 2016, the Government released a public
discussion paper on a possible deferred prosecution agreement scheme in
Australia. An effective deferred prosecution agreement scheme could help
encourage companies to self-report criminal behaviour and provide
enforcement and prosecutorial agencies with a new tool to identify and
bring corporate offenders to justice.

**Ambition\
**To aim to improve Australia’s score on Transparency International
Corruption Perception Index.

To regularly review the jurisdiction and capabilities of ACLEI and FACC,
and extend these on an as-needs basis.

To consult closely with industry, non-government organisations and the
public to ensure that our law, policies and frameworks for responding to
corruption are effective, including through holding the first government
business roundtable on corruption in 2017. We will also consult publicly
on the implementation of recommendations from the Statutory Review of
the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and
associated Rules and Regulations.

To ensure that our laws applying to the bribery of foreign public
officials facilitate effective prosecution.

To assess whether a deferred prosecution agreement scheme would
facilitate more effective and efficient responses to bribery and
corporate corruption by encouraging companies to self-report.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **access** **to
information** and **public accountability** by:

-   improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and
    institutional frameworks; and
-   protecting the integrity and transparency of the execution of public
    policy and management.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   Increasing Public Integrity

**Timeframes\
**End 2016 – 2019

**Lead agency\
**Attorney-General’s Department

**Other actors involved**\
*Government: *ACLEI, Australian Federal Police, Australian Securities
and Investments Commission, Commonwealth Director of Public
