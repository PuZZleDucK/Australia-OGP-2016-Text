==================================================

<div class="entry-content">

Consultation and engagement on the National Action Plan commenced in
November 2015. engage2 (a professional stakeholder engagement
consultancy) was engaged by the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet to help design and lead the consultation process up until April
2016.

A summary of the consultation and engagement activities is provided
below. A more detailed report on engagement activities is available on
the OGP Australia blog (ogpau.govspace.gov.au).

-   Four public information sessions were held in November 2015 to
    provide an overview of the Open Government Partnership and the
    process to develop Australia’s first National Action Plan. The
    sessions, held in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, were
    attended by a total of 162 people, with a further 45 people watching
    the livestreams online.
-   The OGP Australia blog and an email distribution list were
    established to provide public updates on progress and to inform
    stakeholders of engagement opportunities.
-   The hashtag \#OGPau was created to discuss the project on social
    media, including through the Department of the Prime Minister and
    Cabinet’s Twitter account.

<span id="Seeking_ideas_for_the_National_Action_Plan">Seeking ideas for the National Action Plan</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   A wiki (ogpau.wikispaces.com) was created to provide an interactive
    and collaborative forum for stakeholders to suggest commitments that
    could be included in the National Action Plan. Almost 1000 people
    visited the wiki between February and May 2016, and around 200
    suggestions were put forward (all available online on the wiki and
    blog, including a summary).
-   On 12 April 2016, a workshop was held in Canberra to discuss and
    prioritise the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders.
    The workshop was attended by 63 people, with a mix of government,
    civil society, OGP Support Unit and other participants.
-   14 commitment templates were drafted during the workshop, covering
    areas such as open data, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protection,
    beneficial ownership, public participation and the Extractive
    Industries Transparency Initiative. The templates were further
    considered within government and informed the drafting of the
    National Action Plan.

<span id="Government_engagement">Government engagement</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------

An Inter-Departmental Committee was established to ensure the interests
of Australian Government agencies were considered in the development of
the National Action Plan. This Committee was chaired by the Department
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet with participation from high level
officials from the following agencies:

-   Attorney-General’s Department
-   Australian Bureau of Statistics
-   Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
-   Australian Electoral Commission
-   Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
-   Australian Public Service Commission
-   Department of Agriculture and Water Resources
-   Department of Communications and the Arts
-   Department of Defence
-   Department of Education and Training
-   Department of Employment
-   Department of the Environment and Energy
-   Department of Finance
-   Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
-   Department of Health
-   Department of Human Services
-   Department of Immigration and Border Protection
-   Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
-   Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
-   Department of Social Services
-   Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
-   The Treasury
-   Department of Veterans’ Affairs
-   Digital Transformation Agency
-   National Archives of Australia
-   Office of the Australian Information Commissioner

The Committee met four times and also considered material
out-of-session, including the suggested commitments put forward by
stakeholders. Government ministers were also briefed on commitments that
fall within their area of responsibility and on the Open Government
Partnership more broadly.

<span id="Interim_Working_Group">Interim Working Group</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------

An Interim Working Group was established in August 2016 to provide input
and help inform the drafting of the National Action Plan. The Group
comprised equal representation of senior government officials and
stakeholder representatives:

-   Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair): Deputy Secretary, Department of the
    Prime Minister and Cabinet;
-   Ms Fiona McLeod (co-chair): President-elect of the Law Council of
    Australia;
-   Dr Stein Helgeby: Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance;
-   Mr Iain Anderson: Deputy Secretary, Attorney-General’s Department;
-   Mr Timothy Pilgrim: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting
    Australian Information Commissioner;
-   Ms Meghan Quinn: First Assistant Secretary, the Treasury;
-   Ms Anne Lyons: Assistant Director-General, National Archives of
    Australia;
-   The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the
    Accountability Round Table;
-   Ms Maree Adshead: CEO of Open Data Institute Queensland;
-   Mr Peter Timmins: Interim Convenor of the Australian OGP Civil
    Society Network;
-   Mr Mark Zirnsak: Director of Justice and International Mission,
    Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia; and
-   Ms Katherine Szuminska: Co-Founder and Director of the
    OpenAustralia Foundation.

The NSW Information Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Tydd, also sat as a
non-voting jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire
to build stronger relationships with the states on open government
matters.

The group worked together to identify and explore in detail the
potential commitments for the National Action Plan, building on ideas
put forward from earlier consultations. The group also considered the
text of other parts of the National Action Plan, and the approach to
broader consultation and engagement on the draft Plan. Members also
facilitated targeted consultation with their wider networks throughout
the process.

In addition to regular teleconferences and email correspondence, the
Group held three face-to-face meetings in Canberra, and a workshop in
Sydney, which included an hour discussion with the Assistant Minister
for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon Angus Taylor MP.

Agenda papers, meeting minutes and the outcomes of discussions with the
Group have been posted regularly on the OGP Australia blog.
