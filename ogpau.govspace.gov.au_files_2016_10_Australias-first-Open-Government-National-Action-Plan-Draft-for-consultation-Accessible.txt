This draft Plan has been prepared for further public consultation and input. The Australian
Government will finalise this Plan after these processes have taken place.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 21 Introduction
Australia is a successful and stable democracy, with relatively low levels of corruption and a
long, proud history of open government.
In 2015, we were ranked 13 th in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index,
and 9 th in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index.
But in a rapidly changing world – transformed by the digital revolution – it is important
Australia boosts its efforts to become even more open, transparent and accountable, and
improve public engagement. This is crucial as we seek to:
•
build a better society for all Australians and be more responsive to the expectations
of the community;
• stimulate economic growth and innovation;
• foster collaboration between government, business, academia, non-government
organisations and the community; and
•
continue efforts to stamp out corruption, fraud and misconduct.
Governments worldwide are moving towards more open and transparent ways of working,
with 70 countries – including Australia – now signed up to the Open Government
Partnership.
What is the Open Government Partnership?
The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative established in 2011 that aims to
secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower
citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.
Membership requires governments to work with civil society to ‘co-create’ a National Action
Plan every two years, with independent reporting on progress. Civil society is a term used by
the Partnership to broadly refer to people and organisations outside of government,
including non government organisations, business, academia, community groups and the
public.
Importantly, the Open Government Partnership doesn’t prescribe standards that countries
should follow – rather it aims to bring governments and citizens of each country together to
define their own priorities for reform.
The Australian Government confirmed its membership of the Open Government
Partnership in November 2015.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 3This National Action Plan sets out the initial steps the Government will take to achieve the
aim of improving and building confidence in Australian institutions and democracy, and to
uphold the principles in the Open Government Declaration, including to:
•
promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the power of
new technologies to make government more effective and accountable;
•
uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve services,
manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer communities; and
•
embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward
achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own country and
in an increasingly interconnected world.
The Plan sets out an agenda for the next two years across a broad range of important areas:
• Transparency and accountability in business
• Open data and digital transformation
• Access to government information
• Integrity in the public sector
• Public participation and engagement
As our first National Action Plan, it provides a foundation to continue engaging with civil
society to identify new initiatives and strengthen our efforts over time. There is also an
opportunity going forward to work with state, territory and local governments to improve
transparency and integrity at all levels of government.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 42 Efforts to date
The Australian Government has already taken a range of steps towards improving
transparency, integrity and anti-corruption in recent years, which this National Action Plan
will build upon.
Open data and digital transformation of government services are high priorities for the
Government and considerable progress has been made in a short space of time.
•
The Public Data Policy Statement, released in December 2015, commits Australian
Government entities to release non-sensitive data as open by default. Since 2013, the
number of discoverable resources on data.gov.au has grown from approximately
500 to over 20,000.
•
The Digital Transformation Agency (formerly the Digital Transformation Office) has
been established to lead the online transformation of government services, and
provide an integrated policy and strategic capability for whole of government ICT,
ICT procurement and digital. The Digital Transformation Agency will implement
wide scale change in digital capability across government departments, benefiting
the public and other users of government services.
There have been several major initiatives to improve accountability and integrity both
within and outside of government.
•
The Government commissioned an independent review of the parliamentary
entitlements system in August 2015, and has given its in-principle support to all of
the recommendations of the review.
•
The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption reported in
December 2015. The Government has introduced legislation to improve the
governance and accountability of registered organisations (unions and employer
organisations).
Steps have been taken to make government procurement more transparent, and to
encourage innovation by making it easier for start-ups and innovative small businesses to
sell services to government.
•
The National Innovation and Science Agenda committed to establish a new Digital
Marketplace for procuring ICT products and services, and seeking innovative
solutions to policy and service delivery “challenges” through the Business Research
and Innovation Initiative.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 5•
A public ICT dashboard is being developed to improve transparency around
Government ICT performance and progress on major new investments.
The Australian Government has also been active (and in many cases a leader) in
international anti-corruption and tax avoidance / transparency efforts.
•
Australia is a key member of the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group, having led
the development of the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan and the subsequent 2015-
16 Anti-Corruption Implementation Plan. The G20 High Level Principles on Beneficial
Ownership Transparency are also a legacy item of Australia’s 2014 G20 presidency.
•
Australia was also an active participant in the UK’s international anti-corruption
summit in London in May 2016. At the meeting, the Government endorsed the
Global Declaration against Corruption and announced a range of new measures,
including joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and holding an
annual government business roundtable on corruption.
•
In December 2015, the Australian Taxation Office published the first annual Report
of Entity Tax Information, which included the Australian total income, taxable
income and tax paid of large public and private companies operating in Australia.
•
The Voluntary Tax Transparency Code, announced as part of the 2016-17 Budget, is
a set of principles and minimum standards to guide medium and large businesses
on public disclosure of tax information. Adoption of the Code is voluntary, and is
designed to encourage greater transparency within the corporate sector.
These new measures build on other actions taken over the last decade to improve access to
government information and promote transparency and integrity at the federal level:
•
Whistle-blower protections in the public sector were significantly improved by the
Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 , which commenced in January 2014.
•
Freedom of information laws were reformed in 2010, and included the introduction
of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS), which requires Australian Government
agencies to publish a broad range of information on their websites.
•
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner was established in 2010 to
promote access to government information.
•
The Archives Act 1983 was amended in 2010 to reduce the period before which
government information and Cabinet documents are released. A Digital Transition
Policy and Digital Continuity 2020 Policy have also been established, requiring
government information to be created and managed digitally.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 6•
Creative Commons licensing was adopted in 2010 to accommodate access to
government information and bring consistency to licensing arrangements.
State, territory and local governments have also undertaken a range of initiatives to
promote transparency, integrity and access to information at a sub-national level.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 73 Developing this plan
The National Action Plan has been drafted through a process of consultation and
collaboration between government, non-government organisations (including the
Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network), the public and the private
sector.
Over the past year, we undertook a number of activities to explore the breadth of Australian
views on the spectrum of open government issues.
•
Raising awareness: public meetings were held in four capital cities in late 2015 to
raise awareness of Australia’s membership of the Open Government Partnership and
the process to develop Australia’s first National Action Plan. Additional awareness
raising activities were undertaken through social media, government websites,
teleconferences and webinars, and email mailing lists.
•
Seeking ideas: a formal consultation process ran from December 2015 to April 2016
to seek suggestions on potential commitments for the National Action Plan. This
included a formal submission process, teleconferences with stakeholders, and a
workshop with over 60 participants in April 2016 to help prioritise potential
commitments for the Plan. All timeframes for consultation and submissions were
published online.
•
Drafting the National Action Plan: an Interim Working Group, comprising equal
representation of government officials and non-government members, was
established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the drafting of the
National Action Plan, building on earlier consultations.
This engagement has helped shape the National Action Plan and the open government
priorities for the next two years. More details about engagement activities are provided at
Appendix A.
Image 1 – Interim Working Group Workshop
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 84 Commitments
This National Action Plan consists of an ambitious package of 14 commitments. Taken
together, these actions will advance transparency, accountability, public participation and
technological innovation in Australia over the next two years.
The Government will continue to engage publicly to identify new opportunities to promote
open government. New commitments may either be added to this National Action Plan, or
embedded in our second National Action Plan due in 2018.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 9Commitment 1.1: Improve whistle-blower
protections in the tax and corporate sectors
We will improve whistle-blower protections for people who disclose information
about tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office. We will also consult on other
reform options to strengthen and harmonise whistle-blower protections in the
corporate sector with those in the public sector.
Objective: Australia will ensure appropriate protections are in place for people who
report tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste, fraud and misconduct
within the corporate sector.
Status Quo: The prevention of tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud relies
upon appropriate protections for people who report these wrongdoings.
Australian public servants who act as whistle-blowers already have significant
protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act) . This is in
contrast to Australia's corporate whistle-blower framework, which lags
behind the PID Act. Current protections are overly narrow and make it
unnecessarily difficult for those with information to qualify for protections.
A research project into public interest whistleblowing, Whistling While They
Work 2, led by Griffith University, is currently underway and looking into
improvements across the public and private sectors.
In the 2016-17 Budget, the Government announced it would introduce
whistle-blower protections for people who disclose information about tax
misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office.
Ambition: To reduce tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud by
protecting people who report such activities.
Relevance: This commitment will advance the OGP values of public accountability and
transparency by:
•
encouraging, protecting and compensating whistle-blowers whose
information reveals artificial tax structures and misconduct;
•
reducing tax misconduct and other forms of corruption, fraud and
waste by ensuring whistle-blowers are protected from retribution; and
•
ensuring tax and corporate private sector whistle-blowers have similar
protections to public sector whistle-blowers.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 12Commitment 1.2: Beneficial Ownership
We will consult with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and the
public on a beneficial ownership register for companies.
Objective:
Australia will work to improve transparency of information on beneficial
ownership and control of companies available to competent authorities.
Status Quo:
Improving transparency around who owns and benefits from financial
arrangements is key to protecting the integrity of our financial systems and
preventing the misuse of financial entities for corruption and criminal activity.
A beneficial ownership register shows who ultimately benefits from the
activities of companies.
Australia currently has tracing powers for beneficial ownership of listed
companies and investment schemes but there is room to strengthen these
provisions.
Ambition:
To ensure that adequate, accurate and timely information on beneficial
ownership and control is available to competent authorities in Australia.
To improve regional and international cooperation on taxation, including
strengthening information sharing between tax authorities and sharing
learnings to increase the transparency of beneficial ownership information. We
will use outcomes of the work by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and
the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax
Purposes this year to help develop proposals to improve implementation of
relevant international standards on transparency, including on the availability
and exchange of companies’ beneficial ownership information.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks;
•
preventing the misuse of financial arrangements for illicit purposes
such as corruption, tax evasion and money laundering;
• protecting the integrity of the financial system; and
• increasing growth through private sector investment.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 15Commitment 1.3: Natural Resource Transparency
We will work together to enhance disclosure of company payments and government
revenues from oil, gas and mining.
Objective:
Australia will work towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) standard and continue to support the application of EITI principles
around the world.
Status Quo:
The sustainable development of natural resources (oil, gas and minerals) requires
transparent and accountable management of revenue received from these
industries, including taxes, royalties and other payments.
The EITI is a global standard to promote the open and accountable management
of natural resources. The Australian Government has been a major supporter of the
EITI, committing more than A$20 million since 2007.
Australia announced its intention to seek EITI compliance on 6 May 2016, following
a pilot to test the applicability of EITI rules and principles to Australian conditions
between 2011 and 2014. This requires us to report annually on governance and
payments in the oil, gas and mining sectors.
The oil, gas and mining industries face increasing scrutiny. Our commitment to the
EITI standard will help to build the public trust necessary for an enduring and
sustainable industry.
Ambition: To enhance transparency and accountability in the extractive industries sector.
Relevance: This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
providing timely, reliable, publicly available and independently verified
data on the extractives industries’ contribution to the Australian economy;
•
encouraging EITI adoption in resource-rich countries and support a level
playing field for Australian companies seeking to invest in those markets;
•
demonstrating Australia’s commitment to global transparency, anti-
corruption and tackling tax avoidance; consistent with current domestic
and international trends; and
•
supporting the extractive industries’ social licence to operate,
demonstrating its commitment to transparent and accountable
operations.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 17Commitment 2.1: Release high-value datasets and
enable data-driven innovation
We will work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to release high-
value public datasets and drive social and economic outcomes.
Objective:
Australia will continue to make more public data openly available and
support its use to launch commercial and non-profit ventures, conduct
research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.
Status Quo:
Public data is a valuable national resource and its use and reuse can help
grow the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy outcomes.
While significant progress has been made to advance the public data agenda
within Australia, further work needs to be done to harness the full value of
this resource. Ongoing engagement is required to identify the characteristics
of high-value datasets and discover barriers to accessing and sharing data.
The public, research, not-for-profit and private sectors can innovate with this
data in order to generate new business, develop new products and services,
and create social value.
The Government has provided some support to date, including through the
Open Data 500 Australia 1 and the DataStart initiative. 2 There is now the
opportunity to build and expand on these pilot initiatives to encourage the
use of public data for social and economic outcomes.
In the Government’s policy for Better and More Accessible Digital Services , 3
the Government committed to working with research, not-for-profit and
private sectors to identify high-value public datasets for release. This will be
supported by a public registry of significant non-sensitive datasets yet to be
published on data.gov.au. The Government is also establishing a $50 million
Smart Cities and Suburbs Program to incentivise local councils to open up
their data and collaborate with communities, local business, not-for-profits
and research institutes to create innovative solutions to urban problems. 4
The Productivity Commission is undertaking an inquiry into data availability

Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information,
technology and innovation and public participation by:
• identifying and prioritising high-value datasets for priority release;
• understanding how Australian businesses and not-for-profits are using
public data;
• stimulating use and re-use of public data in innovative ways;
• encouraging the use of public data to create social value;
• identifying, facilitating and addressing barriers impeding the sharing
of and access to data; and

to address concerns about data sharing
We will develop an ongoing and collaborative conversation with the community to
build public trust around data sharing and integration.
Objective:
Australia will actively engage with the community regarding how public
data is being used to provide more targeted and effective policy, service
delivery and program evaluation.
Status Quo:
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, effective policy
responses require investment in joined-up data that can provide a strong
evidence-base for policy decisions.
The New Zealand Government has invested in both a whole-of-government
Integrated Data Infrastructure and enhanced analytical capability with
positive results in terms of reduced government spending and improved
public policy outcomes in areas such as human rights, law enforcement,
health, education and justice.
While the Australian Public Service (APS) has made some progress in this
area, we need to better inform the community about the benefits of data
sharing and address public concerns, including perceived values, risks, and
attitudes towards privacy.
The Privacy Act 1988 underpins the open data agenda and helps build
public trust in data-sharing activities. The Government has introduced a Bill
to amend the Act to make it an offence to deliberately re-identify personal
information from open government data.
Data literacy across the APS is also critical. In August 2016, the Department
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet released Data Skills and Capability in the
Australian Public Service to help build skills and knowledge in publishing,
linking and sharing public data.
Ambition:
To build trust about the use of integrated data and actively respond to
community concerns about data sharing. To comply with international best
practice on open data principles and participate in global fora on data.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 22Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency and public
participation by:
•
providing greater transparency on how government is using the
data it collects and protecting personal information;
•
enabling the community to engage with government and raise
issues of concern;
•
enabling experts outside of government to inform public debate;
and
•
providing more targeted and effective policy, service delivery and
program evaluation.

of government services
We will continue to invest in digital technologies to make government services
simpler, faster and cheaper.
Objective:
Australia will harness digital technologies to make it easier for the public to
work and interact with government.
Status Quo:
The Digital Transformation Agency is an executive agency within the Prime
Minister’s portfolio. Its mission is to lead the transformation of government
services to deliver a better experience for Australians.
Innovative use of digital technologies supports the open government agenda,
through the provision of faster, cheaper and more accessible government
services. While some progress has been made, there is an opportunity to seize
the benefits of the digital revolution to improve the way government interacts
with the public.
The Digital Transformation Agency will work with government agencies to
deliver a roadmap for the digital transformation of government services and
will use public dashboards to measure its performance, which will be
benchmarked against best practice in the private sector.
Ambition:
To use digital technologies to promote transparency and public participation
in government service delivery, engaging early and often with users
throughout, so that government services meet the needs of the people who
use them.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of technology and innovation
and transparency by:
• increasing public access to government services;
• making government services more efficient and cheaper; and
• increasing transparency around performance of government service
delivery.

Objective:
Australia will consider options for reforms to the framework for managing and
accessing government information, including the Freedom of Information Act
1982 (FOI Act), the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act) and, where relevant, the
Privacy Act 1988 (with primary focus on the Archives Act and FOI Act), as well
as policies and practices relating to information access and management.
Status Quo:
In 2010, the Australian Government passed reforms to the FOI Act as part of a
broader plan to improve transparency and to encourage public engagement
in decision making. The 2010 reforms also included the introduction of the
Information Publication Scheme, which requires agencies to provide a broad
range of information on their websites, and amendments to the Archives Act
to reduce the open access period for Commonwealth records from 30 to
20 years over a 10 year period.
There have since been a number of reviews recommending changes to the FOI
Act, including Dr Allan Hawke’s Review of Freedom of Information Laws and
the Belcher Red Tape Review . Among other things, the Belcher Red Tape
Review recommended the Attorney-General’s Department “begin work with
relevant entities to scope and develop a simpler and more coherent legislative
framework for managing and accessing government information during its
life-cycle in a digital environment through staged reforms, commencing with
legislation regulating archives.”
The core frameworks of Australia’s information access laws (in particular the
FOI Act and the Archives Act) have not been substantially altered since
enacted in the early 1980s, when government operated in a paper-based
environment. It is therefore appropriate to consider how access to government
information is best managed into the future within the context of digital
government.
Ambition:
To develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework for managing
and accessing government information within the context of digital
government, supported by efficient and effective policies and practices.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 28Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
ensuring government information access laws are modern and capable
of meeting the demands of the digital age;
•
increasing awareness of public access rights to government
information; and
•
improving efficiency of processing access to information requests.

of Information
We will work with states and territories to collect and publish uniform data on public
use of freedom of information access rights in Australia.
Objective:
Australia will develop uniform metrics to better measure and improve our
understanding of the public’s use of rights under freedom of information
laws. 5
Status Quo:
The Commonwealth, states and territories already collect data and produce
statistics about applications to access government information in each
jurisdiction. For example, the Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner currently releases statistics on access requests under the
Freedom of Information Act 1982 through data.gov.au.
However, the data collected is not uniform across jurisdictions, making it
difficult to compare and analyse how freedom of information rights are used
across the country. The development of consistent metrics will assist in
building a more complete picture of freedom of information rights in
Australia and could help governments improve processing of information
access requests. Metrics could include the type of applicant, application rates
per capita, release rates, review rates and refusal rates.
Ambition:
To raise awareness about the public’s rights to access government
information under freedom of information laws and enable quantitative
analysis of data across jurisdictions. This will improve understanding of
utilisation of access rights, government processes and practices, and better
align with established international metrics including the World Justice
Project Open Government Index.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 32Commitment 3.3: Improve the discoverability and
accessibility of government data and information
We will make it easier for the public to find and use government data and
information through central portals and digital platforms.
Objective:
Australia will establish platforms and tools to improve the discoverability and
accessibility of government information and public data.
Status Quo:
The creation, preservation, management and public use of government
information is fundamental to open and transparent government. The
availability of government records and data improves public access to
information, while also driving efficient business outcomes by facilitating use
and reuse of these valuable resources.
It is not enough just to make these resources open; information and public
data must be easy to find and accessible in order for it to be useful. Some
specific examples of areas where the government is seeking to improve public
access to information include:
•
Public data: Data.gov.au is the Australian Government’s open data
platform. It has enabled the open release of over 20,000 public
resources used to grow the economy, improve service delivery and
transform policy outcomes for the nation. As the number of datasets on
data.gov.au grows, Australia’s public data infrastructure needs be
upgraded to meet the demands of data users. This includes improving
search and discovery, enhancing support for collaboration, developing a
quality framework to assist publishers, and developing more robust
publishing processes.
•
Grants: There is no central point to identify and apply for Australian
Government grant opportunities and find consolidated information
about grants awarded. The Department of Finance is building
GrantConnect, a central whole-of-government system that will forecast
and publish grant opportunities, automatically notify public users of
grant opportunities of interest, and publish information on grants
awarded.
•
Corporate and administrative reporting: Corporate and administrative
reporting information is currently located on individual agency
websites or in hard copy, making it difficult to compare and contrast
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 33documents. The Department of Finance and the Department of the
Prime Minister and Cabinet are working with the Digital Transformation
Agency to make reporting information more discoverable and
accessible through the digitisation of this information.
•
Archived records: The most significant records of the Australian
Government are held by the National Archives of Australia. To facilitate
citizens’ access to these records through digital and online channels,
the Archives will continue to lead the transition from paper to digital
information practices in Australian Government agencies, digitise paper
records of high research value and increase the number of records
available for public access.
•
Environmental information: The Department of the Environment and
Energy compiles significant data to produce its State of the
Environment report and meet its other responsibilities (such as
research into the impacts of coal and coal seam gas developments on
ground water). The Department will make the 2017 State of the
Environment report and its underlying data more accessible through
SoE Digital (an innovative and interactive online platform) and
data.gov.au. It will use data visualisation tools to help publish the results
of its coal and coal seam gas bioregional assessments.
Ambition:
To make it as easy as possible to find, access and use government information
and data.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
technology and innovation by:
•
promoting a consistent approach to information governance across
Australian Government entities;
•
increasing transparency of government decision-making and policy
development;
• enabling information and data reuse for economic and social benefits;
• protecting the rights and entitlements of Australians to access
government information;
•
increasing the accessibility, usability and discoverability of public data;
and
•
improving the quality of data.

We will work with the parliament and the public to investigate the conduct of the
2016 election, use of technology in elections and the framework of donations to
political parties and other political entities.
Objective: To enhance integrity and confidence in Australia’s electoral system.
Status Quo: The Government has asked Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on
Electoral Matters (JCSEM) to investigate a range of matters relating to the
conduct of the 2016 federal election, with particular attention to:
•
the potential application of new technology to casting, scrutinising and
counting votes, and whether current authorisations requirements could
be applied to all forms of communication; and
•
donations to political parties and other political entities, including the
extent of donations being received from foreign sources and the
options available to Parliament to regulate these types of donations.
JSCEM will also be asked to look at the current donations disclosure
regime and suggest any alternative approaches.
Ambition:
To ensure that public confidence in Australia’s electoral system continues to be
strong.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of accountability,
transparency and access to information by:
•
reducing the risk of undemocratic behaviour and conduct, which leads
to the perception or reality of corrupt behaviour by politicians and
political parties; and
•
increasing public confidence in Australian democracy.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 40Commitment 4.2: National Integrity Framework
We will collaborate with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and
the public to strengthen our national anti-corruption and integrity framework.
Objective:
Australia will strengthen our ability to prevent, detect and respond to bribery
and corruption. As part of this, we will regularly review the jurisdiction and
capabilities of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
(ACLEI) and the Australian Federal Police’s Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre
to ensure they can focus on protecting Commonwealth agencies from risks of
corruption.
Status Quo:
The Government takes a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to combating
corruption, under which a range of agencies play a role in preventing,
detecting and responding to corruption. We have strong laws applying to
bribery and corruption which carry significant penalties.
ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious issues
of corruption in agencies within its jurisdiction. ACLEI’s jurisdiction focusses on
protecting environments that are most at risk of criminal compromise—
namely, border regulation and law enforcement.
The Integrity Commissioner considers the nature and scope of corruption
revealed by investigations, and reports annually on any patterns and trends in
corruption in Australian Government law enforcement and other government
agencies which have law enforcement functions. Accordingly, ACLEI collects
intelligence about corruption in support of the Integrity Commissioner's
functions.
ACLEI also aims to understand corruption and prevent it. Where the Integrity
Commissioner identifies laws of the Commonwealth or administrative
practices of government agencies that might contribute to corrupt practices
or prevent their early detection, he or she may make recommendations for
these laws or practices to be changed.
As a practitioner agency, ACLEI engages actively with other government
agencies and civil society (nationally and internationally) to collect and share
information to strengthen anti-corruption arrangements in Australia and
abroad. ACLEI’s dissemination program of Information Reports is one means
by which the Integrity Commissioner transmits timely intelligence to relevant
agencies, such as to police and other integrity agencies. ACLEI and the AFP
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 41Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre (FACC) also cross-refer information to one
another, and assist one another with corruption prevention activities.
In 2014, the Government established the FACC located in the AFP
headquarters to bring together a range of Commonwealth agencies to assess,
prioritise and respond to serious fraud and corruption matters, including across
Commonwealth services, programs and employees. The FACC draws on the
collective knowledge of agencies to provide sound contemporary advice in
relation to potential fraud threats relevant to new government funding
initiatives prior to their implementation. In April 2016, the Government
provided an additional $15 million to the FACC to enhance its capacity to
detect and investigate corruption, bribery and serious economic crime.
Between the FACC and ACLEI, there is significant coverage of fraud and
corruption across Australian Government agencies, with a particular focus on
areas of high-corruption risk.
The Government has reviewed ACLEI’s jurisdiction on a number of occasions in
the past and extended its jurisdiction where a need was demonstrated.
In May 2016, the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law
Enforcement Integrity reported on its inquiry into ACLEI’s jurisdiction. Many
public submissions have advocated extension of its coverage to the entire
public sector. The Committee recommended the Government extend ACLEI’s
jurisdiction to include the entire Department of Agriculture and Water
Resources, and examine the feasibility of including the Australian Taxation
Office within ACLEI's jurisdiction. The Government is considering the report’s
recommendations.
The Government is also exploring new responses to corruption and corporate
crime. In March 2016, the Government released a public discussion paper on a
possible deferred prosecution agreement scheme in Australia. An effective
deferred prosecution agreement scheme could help encourage companies to
self-report criminal behaviour and provide enforcement and prosecutorial
agencies with a new tool to identify and bring corporate offenders to justice.
Ambition:
To aim to improve Australia’s score on Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index.
To regularly review the jurisdiction and capabilities of ACLEI and FACC, and
extend these on an as-needs basis.
To consult closely with industry, non-government organisations and the public
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 42to ensure that our law, policies and frameworks for responding to corruption
are effective, including through holding the first government business
roundtable on corruption in 2017. We will also consult publicly on the
implementation of recommendations from the Statutory Review of the Anti-
Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and associated
Rules and Regulations.
To ensure that our laws applying to the bribery of foreign public officials
facilitate effective prosecution.
To assess whether a deferred prosecution agreement scheme would facilitate
more effective and efficient responses to bribery and corporate corruption by
encouraging companies to self-report.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks; and
•
protecting the integrity and transparency of the execution of public
policy and management.

We will undertake a public review of the Australian Government’s compliance with
the Open Contracting Data Standard.
Objective:
Australia will review compliance with the Open Contracting Data
Standard and continue to support the Open Contracting Global
Principles.
Status Quo:
The Open Contracting Data Standard sets out key documents and data
that should be published at each stage of government procurement and
is seen as the international benchmark. The Standard enables disclosure
of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by
defining a common data model. It was created to support organisations
to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of
contracting data by a wide range of users.
In line with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules , Australian
Government entities are required to report all procurement contracts
with a value of $10,000 or more on AusTender. However, there has not
been a formal assessment of the extent to which current practice meets
the requirements of the Open Contracting Data Standard.
At the UK Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016, the Australian
Government stated its support of the Open Contracting Data Standard
and noted the role that the Standard could play in encouraging machine-
readable open data formats across all areas of government.
Ambition:
To enhance transparency and accountability of public money in
delivering public contracts.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information
and public accountability by demonstrating transparency and
accountability in relation to the procurement of goods and services on
behalf of the Government.

Government National Action Plan
We will ensure that Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan is a platform
for ongoing dialogue, collaboration and open government reform.
Objective:
Australia will establish a permanent dialogue mechanism with civil society,
which includes a multi-stakeholder forum. The multi-stakeholder forum will
track the implementation of commitments, ensure commitments continue to
be relevant and ambitious, inform the drafting of future National Action Plans
and raise awareness about open government in the broader community.
Status Quo:
OGP countries are required to establish a multi-stakeholder forum to consult
with the public and organisations outside of government on the
implementation of the commitments included in their National Action Plan.
Detailed guidance on establishing a multi-stakeholder forum is outlined in the
OGP’s handbook. 6
OGP countries have taken different approaches to establishing their multi-
stakeholder forum. Some models adopted in other countries include:
•
Civil society network: Coalition of non-government organisations and
individuals.
•
Single forum: Convenes government, the public and organisations
outside of government in one formally established, central committee
for co-ordination.
•
Hub-and-spoke: Network of smaller forums (broken down by sector,
thematic area or commitments etc.), which may be coordinated by a
central committee.
The Government will work in partnership with civil society to determine the
structure, role, governance and membership of the OGP multi-stakeholder
forum. This may include setting up or continuing interim structures until a
permanent forum can be established.
It is also important that Australia’s commitments remain relevant and
ambitious throughout the National Action Plan cycle. This will be achieved
through ongoing review of milestones, with updates made (as necessary) in
partnership with civil society. The Government will also work with the public to

Ambition:
To identify, develop and implement ambitious open government
commitments through ongoing partnership with civil society.

This commitment will advance the OGP values of public participation and
accountability by:
•
ensuring commitments remain relevant and ambitious throughout the
National Action Plan cycle;
•
keeping government accountable for the implementation of National

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 50Commitment 5.2: Enhance public participation in
government decision making
We will work together to improve public participation in government decision
making for better policy development and service delivery outcomes.
Objective:
Australia will work towards improving public participation and engagement to
enhance policy and service delivery outcomes for Australians.
Status Quo:
Government is comprised of a diverse range of organisations, with approaches
to participation varying considerably across different departments and
agencies. High barriers to participation and piecemeal or unpredictable
approaches to consultation can lead to an inefficient and dissatisfying
experience. The current mechanisms for consultation, which are adapted from
other online processes, often do not fully meet the Government’s practical
requirements for policy and program development. In addition, current
mechanisms can be ineffective in enabling ‘co-design’.
Numerous reviews have highlighted scope for improvement in the way the
Australian Public Service engages with the public when developing policies
and programs. For example, Peter Shergold’s Learning from Failure
recommended that “the APS should promote new forms of civil participation,
including digital and deliberative democracy techniques, in order to enhance
consumer-directed care, improve customer service, encourage greater public
engagement and inform the public economy”.
There is a need to identify and disseminate information on good practices and
help peer exchange between government agencies and across different levels
of government. Digital technologies also open up new opportunities for
engagement and there are a range of innovative techniques that could be
further explored at the Commonwealth level (e.g. policy hacks, online
challenge platforms and citizen juries). In addition, there has been a lack of
investment in social media and on-line tools relevant to public participation in
government decision-making.
The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 also requires
Commonwealth entities to work cooperatively with others to achieve common
objectives, where practicable.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 51Ambition:
To design and adopt a whole-of-government framework that embeds
meaningful, open, public and multi-stakeholder participation into the business
of policy development and service delivery.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency,
accountability and public participation by:
• facilitating informed public participation;
• improving policy development and service delivery;
• enhancing transparency around government decision making;
• encouraging an ongoing sharing of information and views across
interest groups that builds consensus on broad policy directions; and
•
creating more engaged private and community sectors, and public.

We will continue to support countries in our region to build institutions that promote
stability, inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and gender equality. We will also
maintain our support for strengthened dialogue between governments, non-government
organisations, the public and the private sector, so that they can make legitimate demands
of their governments.
Australia’s development cooperation program supports a diverse range of countries, from
highly populous Indonesia to the micro-states of the Pacific. Australia therefore tailors its
cooperation to address the varied economic, political and social factors constraining
effective governance in each country context, including through:
•
reducing opportunities for corruption by strengthening checks and balances, access
to information and complaints processes;
•
assisting partner governments to reform tax policy and administration and improve
public financial management;
•
strengthening regulatory and legal environments so that businesses have greater
certainty and predictability;
•
supporting the public and businesses to resolve disputes through formal legal
systems, alternative mechanisms or institutions that combine both;
•
promoting gender equality and enhancing women’s voice in decision-making,
leadership and peace-building; and
•
building coalitions and opportunities for discussion across government, business,
non-government organisations and the public to improve public policy and
government accountability.
Australia is committed to the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action
Agenda on Financing for Development. The National Action Plan will support the
achievement of the SDGs in Australia and globally, in particular Goal 16 on peaceful and
inclusive societies, access to justice and effective institutions. Australia strongly advocated
for this goal, which will be critical for the success of the entire 2030 Agenda.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 54Australia will also endorse the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , which commits us to
transparency, openness and accountability in our domestic and international
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As a member of the Open Government Partnership, we also note our responsibility to work
globally to fight corruption, empower citizens and enhance transparency and integrity. We
will continue to work with other countries to help achieve these goals, including through
our support for the effective implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption and
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Australia, our region and beyond.
Australia will also continue to participate actively in forums such as the G20 Anti-Corruption
Working Group and OECD Development Assistance Committee networks on governance,
conflict and fragility.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 55Appendix A: Consultation and engagement
activities
Consultation and engagement on the National Action Plan commenced in November 2015.
engage 2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to help design and lead the consultation
process up until April 2016.
A summary of the consultation and engagement activities is provided below. A more
detailed report on engagement activities is available on the OGP Australia blog
(ogpau.govspace.gov.au).
Public meetings and other awareness raising activities
•
Four public information sessions were held in November 2015 to provide an overview
of the Open Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first
National Action Plan. The sessions, held in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and
Canberra, were attended by a total of 162 people, with a further 45 people watching
the livestreams online.
•
The OGP Australia blog and an email distribution list were established to provide
public updates on progress and to inform stakeholders of engagement
opportunities.
•
The hashtag #OGPau was created to discuss the project on social media, including
through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s Twitter account.
Seeking ideas for the National Action Plan
•
A wiki (ogpau.wikispaces.com) was created to provide an interactive and
collaborative forum for stakeholders to suggest commitments that could be
included in the National Action Plan. Almost 1000 people visited the wiki between
February and May 2016, and around 200 suggestions were put forward (all available
online on the wiki and blog, including a summary).
•
On 12 April 2016, a workshop was held in Canberra to discuss and prioritise the
suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. The workshop was attended
by 63 people, with a mix of government, civil society, OGP Support Unit and other
participants.
•
14 commitment templates were drafted during the workshop, covering areas such
as open data, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protection, beneficial ownership,
public participation and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The
templates were further considered within government and informed the drafting of
the National Action Plan.
