5.1 – Delivery of Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan {#delivery-of-australias-open-government-national-action-plan .entry-title}
==================================================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will ensure that Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan is
a platform for ongoing dialogue, collaboration and open government
reform.*

**Objective\
**Australia will establish a permanent dialogue mechanism with civil
society, which includes a multi stakeholder forum. The multi-stakeholder
forum will track the implementation of commitments, ensure commitments
continue to be relevant and ambitious, inform the drafting of future
National Action Plans and raise awareness about open government in the
broader community.

**Status Quo\
**OGP countries are required to establish a multi-stakeholder forum to
consult with the public and organisations outside of government on the
implementation of the commitments included in their National Action
Plan. Detailed guidance on establishing a multi-stakeholder forum is
outlined in the OGP’s handbook.

OGP countries have taken different approaches to establishing their
multi-stakeholder forum. Some models adopted in other countries include:

-   Civil society network: Coalition of non-government organisations
    and individuals.
-   Single forum: Convenes government, the public and organisations
    outside of government in one formally established, central committee
    for co-ordination.
-   Hub-and-spoke: Network of smaller forums (broken down by sector,
    thematic area or commitments etc.), which may be coordinated by a
    central committee.

The Government will work in partnership with civil society to determine
the structure, role, governance and membership of the OGP multi
stakeholder forum. This may include setting up or continuing interim
structures until a permanent forum can be established.

It is also important that Australia’s commitments remain relevant and
ambitious throughout the National Action Plan cycle. This will be
achieved through ongoing review of milestones, with updates made (as
necessary) in partnership with civil society. The Government will also
work with the public to identify any additional commitments that could
be included in the National Action Plan over the two year cycle.

**Ambition\
**To identify, develop and implement ambitious open government
commitments through ongoing partnership with civil society.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **public
participation** and **accountability** by:

-   ensuring commitments remain relevant and ambitious throughout the
    National Action Plan cycle;
-   keeping government accountable for the implementation of National
    Action Plan commitments;
-   raising awareness about the Open Government Partnership and open
    government matters in Australia and the region; and
-   ensuring participation by a broad and diverse range of organisations
    and the public in the development of National Action
    Plan commitments.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   All Grand Challenges addressed

**Timeframes\
**December 2016 – July 2018

**Lead agency\
**Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet

**Other actors involved**\
*Government:* All Commonwealth entities

*Non-government:* Australian Open Government Civil Society Network,

1.  Partner with the public and organisations outside of government to
    determine the structure, role, governance and membership of the OGP
    multi-stakeholder forum.
    -   December 2016 – Early 2017

2.  Establish a permanent multi-stakeholder forum, with (at a minimum)
    the following responsibilities: develop and co-create future
    National Action Plans; track and report on implementation of
    National Action Plan commitments; facilitate broader community
    engagement and conduct awareness activities that foster informed
    participation; and document decisions and publish reports.
    -   Early 2017 – July 2018

3.  Review the National Action Plan and update milestones and
    commitments (as necessary) to provide further clarity and ambition
    for plan.
