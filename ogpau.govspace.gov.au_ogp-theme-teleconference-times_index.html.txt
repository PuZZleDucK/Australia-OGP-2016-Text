If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for
Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with
others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.

The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought
it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions
suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The
intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you
meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.

I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you
might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through
the wiki.

The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:

-   13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
-   14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
-   15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
-   16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity

The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:

-   12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
-   13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
-   14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
-   15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
-   17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU

I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at
the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.

I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st
between 11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an
action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.

I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next
meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

Amelia

    Gosh. There’s late notice and then there’s late notice 🙁

    I appreciate getting an email invite (since I didn’t hear about this
    any other way) but the email was sent after close of business on a 4
    day long Easter weekend for a call happening the day everyone’s back
    from holidays (not to mention 2 days out from the deadline).

    I’m very disappointed to be unable to participate due to this lack
    of notice.

    &gt;I have also posted links under each themes in the wiki so you
    can register for events and access the teleconference details.

    Why not link them here so they’re accessible:

    Tuesday the 29th March:

    \* 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU – “If you have not
    received an invitation and you would like to attend please get in
    touch.”

    Is the final teleconference intentionally invite only? I might try
    to make that since it’s the one with the most lead time.

        Hi Henare. Thanks for posting the links Henare. I invited
        everyone who had suggested an action under a theme to attend and
        posted the link to register on the wiki pages for each theme.
        These events are being held to encourage and complement three
        way engagement on the wiki. I am also adding summaries of
        discussions on each theme pages of the wiki to boost three
        way engagement. The intent is to be as available as I can to
        those of you suggesting actions before submissions
        close Thursday. My team scheduled the Ongoing Engagement session
        as our first event, but I thought it should be last based on
        theme based discussions so needed to modify in eventbrite before
        posting the link. Those who have suggested actions under this
        theme received an email invitation on Thursday. I’ve been unwell
        this weekend and in teleconferences most of today so forgot to
        post it on the theme – thanks for the reminder. Amelia
