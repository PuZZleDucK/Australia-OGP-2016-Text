****** OGPAU theme teleconference times ******
Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye
If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 ‚Äì 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 ‚Äì 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 ‚Äì 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 ‚Äì 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 ‚Äì 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 ‚Äì 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 ‚Äì 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 ‚Äì 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 ‚Äì 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am ‚Äì 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I‚Äôll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

      Gosh. There‚Äôs late notice and then there‚Äôs late notice üôÅ
      I appreciate getting an email invite (since I didn‚Äôt hear about this any
      other way) but the email was sent after close of business on a 4 day long
      Easter weekend for a call happening the day everyone‚Äôs back from holidays
      (not to mention 2 days out from the deadline).
      I‚Äôm very disappointed to be unable to participate due to this lack of
      notice.

      Is the final teleconference intentionally invite only? I might try to
      make that since it‚Äôs the one with the most lead time.

            Hi Henare. Thanks for posting the links Henare. I invited everyone
            who had suggested an action under a theme to attend and posted the
            link to register on the wiki pages for each theme. These events are
            being held to encourage and complement three way engagement on the
            wiki. I am also adding summaries of discussions on each theme pages
            of the wiki to boost three way engagement. The intent is to be as
            available as I can to those of you suggesting actions before
            submissions close Thursday. My team scheduled the Ongoing
            Engagement session as our first event, but I thought it should be
            last based on theme based discussions so needed to modify in
            eventbrite before posting the link. Those who have suggested
            actions under this theme received an email invitation on Thursday.
            I‚Äôve been unwell this weekend and in teleconferences most of today
            so forgot to post it on the theme ‚Äì thanks for the reminder. Amelia
