The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce
the members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the
collaborative spirit of the OGP.

The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely
competitive field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public
engagement with Australia’s process to join the OGP. They bring a wide
breadth of experience across a range of fields relevant to open
government, and represent a diverse range of interests and sectors.

Meet the civil society representatives:

-   **Ms Fiona McLeod SC (co-chair):** Fiona is the President-elect of
    the Law Council of Australia and has also previously served as the
    President of the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the
    Victorian Bar, and as a member of the Law Council Executive Board.
    Fiona brings considerable leadership experience to her role as
    co-chair, and substantial experience working with government,
    corporate and non-government sectors. The Law Council engages
    closely in parliamentary and public sector reform processes related
    to transparency and strengthening the integrity of public offices.
-   **The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill**: Ken is an Associate Professor at Monash
    University with research and teaching interests in government
    accountability and governance. He is also a former Member of
    Parliament in Victoria, and Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the
    Accountability Round Table, which advocates for transparency as a
    key factor of accountability. Ken has written extensively on
    Commonwealth, State and Territory government accountability and
    parliamentary reforms.
-   **Mr Mark Zirnsak:** Mark is the Director of the Social Justice Unit
    of the Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia.
    In this role, he has advocated for transparency, accountability and
    open government, including through his involvement in Publish What
    You Pay Australia, Transparency International Australia and as a
    member of the Secretariat for the Tax Justice Network in Australia.
-   **Ms Maree Adshead:** Maree is the CEO of the Open Data Institute
    Queensland, a node of the international Open Data Institute. She has
    held a number of industry representative roles, including as past
    Chair of the Technology Council of the Chamber of Commerce and
    Industry Queensland, and past Chair of the Australian Information
    Industry Association Queensland. ODI Queensland promotes the release
    of public data to increase accountability, improve efficiencies, and
    to drive technological innovation.
-   **Mr Peter Timmins:** Peter is the Interim Convener of the OGP Civil
    Society Network, a coalition of civil society organisations and
    individuals committed to making government work better through
    transparency, participation and accountability. He also has
    considerable experience engaging with freedom of information and
    privacy laws, including as a member of the Australian Law Reform
    Commission Advisory Committee for the Inquiry into Secrecy Laws and
    Open Government in Australia, and the NSW Information and Privacy
    Advisory Committee.
-   **Ms Katherine Szuminska:** Kat is the Co-Founder and Director of
    the OpenAustralia Foundation and also sits on the Steering Committee
    of the OGP Civil Society Network. The OpenAustralia Foundation uses
    technologies and tools to encourage public participation in the
    political process, and to advocate for more transparency and
    accountability in government. Kat has a strong knowledge of the OGP,
    having been involved in various international OGP events.

Meet the government representatives:

-   **Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair):** Deputy Secretary, Innovation &
    Transformation, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
-   **Dr Stein Helgeby**: Deputy Secretary, Governance & APS
    Transformation, Department of Finance.
-   **Mr Iain Anderson:** Deputy Secretary, Civil Justice and Corporate
    Group, Attorney-General’s Department.
-   **Ms Meghan Quinn:** Division Head, Financial System Division, The
    Treasury
-   **Mr Timothy Pilgrim**: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting
    Australian Information Commissioner.
-   **Ms Anne Lyons**: Assistant Director-General, Government
    Information Assurance & Policy, National Archives of Australia.

The NSW Information Commissioner, **Ms Elizabeth Tydd** will also be a
non-voting jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire
to build stronger relationships with the states on open government
matters.

Thank you once again to everyone who submitted an expression of
interest. The Interim Working Group will be continuing to engage with
all interested stakeholders as they work to co-draft Australia’s first
National Action Plan. We invite you to [sign
up](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) to the mailing list for updates, and stay
tuned to this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other
details of the Interim Working Group’s progress.

**Selection process**

The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C
received around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society
positions on the Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior
executives from key agencies to represent the Government on the Interim
Working Group.

PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the
call for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked
by suitability against these criteria, which included their experience
and expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in
engaging with stakeholders and/or government.

We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the
applicants were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a
number of factors (e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a
variety of sectors and indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant
skills). The selected civil society representatives provide a good mix
of experience across the spectrum of open government issues, and bring a
wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.

The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to
contact <OGP@pmc.gov.au> for feedback on their application.

engagement with Australia’s process to join the Open Government
Partnership. Regardless of who is selected for the Interim Working
Group, we look forward to continuing to work with all interested parties
as we co-draft Australia’s first National Action Plan.

We are endeavouring to notify applicants of the outcome of their
submission over the coming days. PM&C is also engaging with key agencies
to finalise the government members of the Interim Working Group.

As always, any enquiries can be submitted to this blog or to
<OGP@pmc.gov.au>.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to
help co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government
Partnership (OGP).

The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society
consultations conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed
commitments submitted by stakeholders can be accessed
[here](../../files/2016/08/Australias-National-Action-Plan-Stocktake-of-commitments.pdf)**.**

The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for
possible inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be
considered by the Government before its submission to the OGP by 1
November 2016.

A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working
Group and arrangements for membership can be accessed
[here.](../../files/2016/08/Interim-Working-Group-Draft-ToR_FINAL.docx)
The draft Terms of Reference will be considered by the Interim Working
Group at its first meeting.

This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to
provide a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify
new initiatives over time that will strengthen transparency,
accountability and public participation in government.

**Process**

The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of
civil society stakeholders.

EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to
supporting transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim
Working Group will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a
civil society representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are
interested in co-chairing the Working Group.

Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able
to attend:

-   a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
-   a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).

Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work
with civil society groups to help cover travel costs and associated
expenses for the workshop.

In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:

-   the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
    geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and
    industries);
-   experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
    stakeholders and/or government; and
-   for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.

EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via
email to <ogp@pmc.gov.au> by **5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.**

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking
to further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other
interest groups over the course of August and September to finalise the
Australian Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open
Government Partnership (OGP) by the end of October 2016.

Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half
of 2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of
commitments that not only meet government and civil society’s
objectives, but also meet the core OGP requirement that the NAP be
developed publically and transparently in a spirit of genuine
partnership.

We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put
forward through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals
where appropriate.  It will also allow us to take account of the
outcomes from the United Kingdom Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016
and other countries NAPs as appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration
of the Plan.

Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these
consultations and engagement. We would welcome suggestions from
interested parties.

<div class="entry-content">

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for
Australia’s first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government.
Stakeholders from civil society and Government came together in Canberra
to discuss suggest actions, prioritise them and draft commitment
templates. It was momentous day. Our agenda was ambitious and the
results excellent. We were productive because of the goodwill and hard
work of those in the room.

I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants
in both civil society and government. The team leading development of
the NAP at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have
are pleased with the event, participation and the outputs generated.

**Participants in the co-creation workshop**\
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the
workshop. Participants included:

-   36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open
    Gov actions
-   4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
    Transformation
-   15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital
    Transformation Office; Department of Finance; National Archives;
    Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
-   1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
-   The Information Commissioner from NSW
-   2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
-   2 from State Governments
-   2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process

**Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates**\
Participants at the workshop discussed the [210 actions suggested by
civil society](../../category/submissions/index.html) and those
suggested by agencies through the [InterDepartmental Committee
(IDC).](../../second-idc/index.html)Actions were grouped into 18
proposals which were then prioritised by participants and turned into 14
commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of the workshop and details of
attendees are available on [this page of the
wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=ace219a644fa786aeac66dd71aafacc1)

**What happens next?**\
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated
to lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the
NAP and these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP
before it is submitted to the OGP in July.

See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan [on this
wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667)

**Ongoing engagement for OGPAU**\
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might
be managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored
opportunities for ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have
been recorded on [this page of the
wiki,](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f4b28aa38bcdd30f84d51d686e2f305e)and
we would like to invite those of you not in the room to contribute to
this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a commitment
around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my
engagement report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so
we can use it in our recommendations.

**Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia**\
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support
Unit and I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government
across Australia. The [Australian Open Government Partnership
Network](https://opengovernment.org.au/) (civil society) also
coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government
in Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.

I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in
this process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C
and I have been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the
commitment you have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an
honour getting to know you all and learning more about your work.
Throughout this project I have been capturing [what I have learned about
Open Government in
Australia.](../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html#comment-373)
This input will also be included in my engagement report in late May. 
Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to
include.

To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance
Open Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details
with PM&C, the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams
coordinating Open Government in State Government, and others in Civil
Society keen to connect with you on this topic. If you would like to
provide consent for any or all of these uses of your personal
information, please complete [this 2 minute
survey](https://app.surveygizmo.com/builder/build/id/2719702) so I know
who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the 14th
May.

Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open
Government have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested
actions on the [wiki](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html). This
marks the end of [Stage 2 of our engagement
process](../../contribute/index.html), which was designed to raise
awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31^st^ March.

We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and
organisations. The level of investment of those who participated in this
process has been really impressive and the insight and experience of
participants is evident in the quality of submissions we received. There
is considerable passion and commitment to open government from our
community.

We have now commenced [Stage 3](../../contribute/index.html)of the
process to develop the National Action Plan (NAP) and are working with
those who suggested actions to prioritise them and draft the NAP
document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action have now
been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in Canberra
this Monday, the 11^th^ April 2016.

During this workshop participants will work together to develop the
National Action Plan, completing [commitment
templates](../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html){.broken_link}
provided by the international[Open Government
Partnership.](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)Representatives from
civil society and government agencies will discuss all suggested actions
so they can be grouped and prioritised. Two members of the International
Open Government Partnership Support Unit will also be at the workshop to
lend their support with this process.

This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC)
meeting to discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government
initiatives to include in the background section and build upon, and the
priorities of government agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the
workshop. On Wednesday, this
[wiki](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667)
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and
methodology sections of the National Action Plan document. A [blog
update](../../category/updates/index.html) was also sent out by PM&C to
share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to
submissions received and from their own research and analysis.

During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy
Secretary of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime
Minister and Cabinet and representatives of various Federal Government
Departments about how Open Government is being implemented in Australia
and government priorities for the NAP.

All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but
the National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a
suggested action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support
on Monday to co-create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to
brief nominated lead agencies about them after the event.

The agenda for this workshop is available
[here](../../files/2016/04/Agenda-cocreation-workshop.pdf). The opening
of this workshop will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 –
10:15am so you can see the opening and ask questions of our speakers.
[Here is the link to the GoogeHangout](https://t.co/TrhH6d1aZc)– a
public event anyone can attend online.

We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process
after the workshop next week.
