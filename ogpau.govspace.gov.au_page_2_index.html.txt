The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce the
members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the collaborative
spirit of the OGP.
The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely competitive
field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public engagement with Australia’s
process to join the OGP. They bring a wide breadth of experience across a range
of fields relevant to open government, and represent a diverse range of
interests and sectors.
Meet the civil society representatives:
    * Ms Fiona McLeod SC (co-chair): Fiona is the President-elect of the Law
      Council of Australia and has also previously served as the President of
      the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the Victorian Bar, and as a
      member of the Law Council Executive Board. Fiona brings considerable
      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience
      working with government, corporate and non-government sectors. The Law
      Council engages closely in parliamentary and public sector reform
      processes related to transparency and strengthening the integrity of
      public offices.

      Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia. In this
      role, he has advocated for transparency, accountability and open

      Australia, Transparency International Australia and as a member of the
      Secretariat for the Tax Justice Network in Australia.
    * Ms Maree Adshead: Maree is the CEO of the Open Data Institute Queensland,
      a node of the international Open Data Institute. She has held a number of
      industry representative roles, including as past Chair of the Technology

      accountability, improve efficiencies, and to drive technological
      innovation.
    * Mr Peter Timmins: Peter is the Interim Convener of the OGP Civil Society
      Network, a coalition of civil society organisations and individuals

Thank you once again to everyone who submitted an expression of interest. The
Interim Working Group will be continuing to engage with all interested
stakeholders as they work to co-draft Australia’s first National Action Plan.
We invite you to sign_up to the mailing list for updates, and stay tuned to
this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

Australia’s National Action Plan have now closed, with approximately 40

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

****** Results_of_the_co-creation_workshop_and_ongoing_engagement ******
Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.
See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan on_this_wiki.
Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.

Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government
have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the wiki.
This marks the end of Stage_2_of_our_engagement_process, which was designed to
raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31st March.
We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations.
The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.
