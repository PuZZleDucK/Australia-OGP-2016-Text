On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in Sydney.
The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus
Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil society members
about their priorities for the open government agenda. Assistant Minister
Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate
as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open
data agenda and digital transformation of government.
In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on the
draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members agreed to work
together during this period to raise awareness about the Open Government
Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse range of stakeholders on
the draft Plan.
