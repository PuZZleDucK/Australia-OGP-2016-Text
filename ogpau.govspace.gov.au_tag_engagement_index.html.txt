The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce
the members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the
collaborative spirit of the OGP.

The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely
competitive field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public
engagement with Australia’s process to join the OGP. They bring a wide
breadth of experience across a range of fields relevant to open
government, and represent a diverse range of interests and sectors.

Meet the civil society representatives:

-   **Ms Fiona McLeod SC (co-chair):** Fiona is the President-elect of
    the Law Council of Australia and has also previously served as the
    President of the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the
    Victorian Bar, and as a member of the Law Council Executive Board.
    Fiona brings considerable leadership experience to her role as
    co-chair, and substantial experience working with government,
    corporate and non-government sectors. The Law Council engages
    closely in parliamentary and public sector reform processes related
    to transparency and strengthening the integrity of public offices.
-   **The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill**: Ken is an Associate Professor at Monash
    University with research and teaching interests in government
    accountability and governance. He is also a former Member of
    Parliament in Victoria, and Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the
    Accountability Round Table, which advocates for transparency as a
    key factor of accountability. Ken has written extensively on
    Commonwealth, State and Territory government accountability and
    parliamentary reforms.
-   **Mr Mark Zirnsak:** Mark is the Director of the Social Justice Unit
    of the Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia.
    In this role, he has advocated for transparency, accountability and
    open government, including through his involvement in Publish What
    You Pay Australia, Transparency International Australia and as a
    member of the Secretariat for the Tax Justice Network in Australia.
-   **Ms Maree Adshead:** Maree is the CEO of the Open Data Institute
    Queensland, a node of the international Open Data Institute. She has
    held a number of industry representative roles, including as past
    Chair of the Technology Council of the Chamber of Commerce and
    Industry Queensland, and past Chair of the Australian Information
    Industry Association Queensland. ODI Queensland promotes the release
    of public data to increase accountability, improve efficiencies, and
    to drive technological innovation.
-   **Mr Peter Timmins:** Peter is the Interim Convener of the OGP Civil
    Society Network, a coalition of civil society organisations and
    individuals committed to making government work better through
    transparency, participation and accountability. He also has
    considerable experience engaging with freedom of information and
    privacy laws, including as a member of the Australian Law Reform
    Commission Advisory Committee for the Inquiry into Secrecy Laws and
    Open Government in Australia, and the NSW Information and Privacy
    Advisory Committee.
-   **Ms Katherine Szuminska:** Kat is the Co-Founder and Director of
    the OpenAustralia Foundation and also sits on the Steering Committee
    of the OGP Civil Society Network. The OpenAustralia Foundation uses
    technologies and tools to encourage public participation in the
    political process, and to advocate for more transparency and
    accountability in government. Kat has a strong knowledge of the OGP,
    having been involved in various international OGP events.

Meet the government representatives:

-   **Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair):** Deputy Secretary, Innovation &
    Transformation, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
-   **Dr Stein Helgeby**: Deputy Secretary, Governance & APS
    Transformation, Department of Finance.
-   **Mr Iain Anderson:** Deputy Secretary, Civil Justice and Corporate
    Group, Attorney-General’s Department.
-   **Ms Meghan Quinn:** Division Head, Financial System Division, The
    Treasury
-   **Mr Timothy Pilgrim**: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting
    Australian Information Commissioner.
-   **Ms Anne Lyons**: Assistant Director-General, Government
    Information Assurance & Policy, National Archives of Australia.

The NSW Information Commissioner, **Ms Elizabeth Tydd** will also be a
non-voting jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire
to build stronger relationships with the states on open government
matters.

Thank you once again to everyone who submitted an expression of
interest. The Interim Working Group will be continuing to engage with
all interested stakeholders as they work to co-draft Australia’s first
National Action Plan. We invite you to [sign
up](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) to the mailing list for updates, and stay
tuned to this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other
details of the Interim Working Group’s progress.

**Selection process**

The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C
received around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society
positions on the Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior
executives from key agencies to represent the Government on the Interim
Working Group.

PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the
call for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked
by suitability against these criteria, which included their experience
and expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in
engaging with stakeholders and/or government.

We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the
applicants were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a
number of factors (e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a
variety of sectors and indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant
skills). The selected civil society representatives provide a good mix
of experience across the spectrum of open government issues, and bring a
wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.

The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to
contact <OGP@pmc.gov.au> for feedback on their application.

**OGP engagement update – 1st March**\
*by Amelia Loye engage2*

It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister
and Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.

I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and
organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and
encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really
amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share
what I learn with you in this blog and email update.

You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action
Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement
strategy are now live on the
[website.](../../contribute/get-involved/index.html)

I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to
continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders
passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene
conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I
would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage
engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on
phone 0411960585 or by email at <amelia@engage2.com.au>.

**Engaging your networks:** I have been working with a range of
different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government
Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working
with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions
with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have
not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also
connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions
in areas that interest you through the International Open Government
Working Groups.

**Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:** The document is
being drafted [live](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)[on the
wiki](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html) so you can observe and
comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and
workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love
to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across
the Country.

**What’s happening with your input:** I collate all input received and
report back weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and
face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and
email submissions.

Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the
Open Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a
summary of your input to date.

As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki
so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal
submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as
they are received.

Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look
forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the
coming weeks.

Amelia Loye\
