The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce the
members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the collaborative
spirit of the OGP.
The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely competitive
field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public engagement with Australia’s
process to join the OGP. They bring a wide breadth of experience across a range
of fields relevant to open government, and represent a diverse range of
interests and sectors.
Meet the civil society representatives:
    * Ms Fiona McLeod SC (co-chair): Fiona is the President-elect of the Law
      Council of Australia and has also previously served as the President of
      the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the Victorian Bar, and as a
      member of the Law Council Executive Board. Fiona brings considerable
      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience
      working with government, corporate and non-government sectors. The Law
      Council engages closely in parliamentary and public sector reform
      processes related to transparency and strengthening the integrity of
      public offices.
    * The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Ken is an Associate Professor at Monash
      University with research and teaching interests in government
      accountability and governance. He is also a former Member of Parliament
      in Victoria, and Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the Accountability Round
      Table, which advocates for transparency as a key factor of
      accountability. Ken has written extensively on Commonwealth, State and
      Territory government accountability and parliamentary reforms.
    * Mr Mark Zirnsak: Mark is the Director of the Social Justice Unit of the
      Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia. In this
      role, he has advocated for transparency, accountability and open
      government, including through his involvement in Publish What You Pay
      Australia, Transparency International Australia and as a member of the
      Secretariat for the Tax Justice Network in Australia.
    * Ms Maree Adshead: Maree is the CEO of the Open Data Institute Queensland,
      a node of the international Open Data Institute. She has held a number of
      industry representative roles, including as past Chair of the Technology
      Council of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland, and past
      Chair of the Australian Information Industry Association Queensland. ODI
      Queensland promotes the release of public data to increase
      accountability, improve efficiencies, and to drive technological
      innovation.
    * Mr Peter Timmins: Peter is the Interim Convener of the OGP Civil Society
      Network, a coalition of civil society organisations and individuals
      committed to making government work better through transparency,
      participation and accountability. He also has considerable experience
      engaging with freedom of information and privacy laws, including as a
      member of the Australian Law Reform Commission Advisory Committee for the
      Inquiry into Secrecy Laws and Open Government in Australia, and the NSW
      Information and Privacy Advisory Committee.
    * Ms Katherine Szuminska:Kat is the Co-Founder and Director of the
      OpenAustralia Foundation and also sits on the Steering Committee of the
      OGP Civil Society Network. The OpenAustralia Foundation uses technologies
      and tools to encourage public participation in the political process, and
      to advocate for more transparency and accountability in government. Kat
      has a strong knowledge of the OGP, having been involved in various
      international OGP events.

jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire to build stronger

Thank you once again to everyone who submitted an expression of interest. The
Interim Working Group will be continuing to engage with all interested
stakeholders as they work to co-draft Australia’s first National Action Plan.
We invite you to sign_up to the mailing list for updates, and stay tuned to
this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.
Amelia Loye
