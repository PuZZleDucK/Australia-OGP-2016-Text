****** Consultation Stage 2: Commitments Drafting and Live Event ******
Posted on December_14,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh
The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://
      ogpau.wikispaces.com/
    * A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air
      ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to
      the consultation. Please subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list to indicate
      your interest in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to
      present their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where
      and when this forum will take place will be published on this website
      closer to the date.
    * You can add comments to this Stage 2 Blog post (below).
    * Tweet your thoughts to #ogpau.
