The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce the
members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the collaborative
spirit of the OGP.
The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely competitive
field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public engagement with Australia’s
process to join the OGP. They bring a wide breadth of experience across a range
of fields relevant to open government, and represent a diverse range of
interests and sectors.
Meet the civil society representatives:

      Council of Australia and has also previously served as the President of
      the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the Victorian Bar, and as a

      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience
      working with government, corporate and non-government sectors. The Law

      processes related to transparency and strengthening the integrity of
      public offices.

      Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia. In this
      role, he has advocated for transparency, accountability and open

this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.
