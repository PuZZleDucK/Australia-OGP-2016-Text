Australia’s leadership internationally {#australias-leadership-internationally .entry-title}
======================================

<div class="entry-content">

This National Action Plan focuses on domestic initiatives, but Australia
also plays an important role in promoting more effective governance in
the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.

We will continue to support countries in our region to build
institutions that promote stability, inclusive economic growth, poverty
reduction and gender equality. We will also maintain our support for
strengthened dialogue between governments, non-government organisations,
the public and the private sector, so that they can make legitimate
demands of their governments.

Australia’s development cooperation program supports a diverse range of
countries, from highly populous Indonesia to the micro-states of the
Pacific. Australia therefore tailors its cooperation to address the
varied economic, political and social factors constraining effective
governance in each country context, including through:

-   reducing opportunities for corruption by strengthening checks and
    balances, access to information and complaints processes;
-   assisting partner governments to reform tax policy and
    administration and improve public financial management;
-   strengthening regulatory and legal environments so that businesses
    have greater certainty and predictability;
-   supporting the public and businesses to resolve disputes through
    formal legal systems, alternative mechanisms or institutions that
    combine both;
-   promoting gender equality and enhancing women’s voice in
    decision-making, leadership and peace-building; and
-   building coalitions and opportunities for discussion across
    government, business, non-government organisations and the public to
    improve public policy and government accountability.

Australia is committed to the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, which includes the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for
Development. The National Action Plan will support the achievement of
the SDGs in Australia and globally, in particular Goal 16 on peaceful
and inclusive societies, access to justice and effective institutions.
Australia strongly advocated for this goal, which will be critical for
the success of the entire 2030 Agenda.

Australia will also endorse the *Joint Declaration on Open Government
for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development*,
which commits us to transparency, openness and accountability in our
domestic and international implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development.

As a member of the Open Government Partnership, we also note our
responsibility to work globally to fight corruption, empower citizens
and enhance transparency and integrity. We will continue to work with
other countries to help achieve these goals, including through our
support for the effective implementation of the UN Convention against
Corruption and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in
Australia, our region and beyond. Australia will also continue to
participate actively in forums such as the G20 Anti-Corruption Working
Group and OECD Development Assistance Committee networks on governance,
conflict and fragility.
