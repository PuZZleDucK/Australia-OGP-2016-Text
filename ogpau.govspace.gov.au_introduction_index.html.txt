****** Introduction ******
In November 2015 the Australian Government committed to finalising membership
of the Open_Government_Partnership (OGP) and this public consultation was
launched to develop an Australian_Government_National_Action_Plan for open
government.
The Australia_page_on_the_OGP_website has a copy of the letter sent from the
Prime Minister to the OGP Co-Chairs and Support Unit expressing his commitment
to finalise Australia’s membership with the OGP.
The OGP is a voluntary, multi-stakeholder international initiative created to
promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new
technologies to strengthen governance.
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, being one of the
most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However,
there is always more that can be done. Through consultation, the aim is for the
first Australian Government’s National Action Plan to include ambitious actions
that support the OGP grand challenges of improving public servicesand better
managing public resources.
Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public service
delivery, increase the transparency and accountability of government, and
encourage greater public engagement. It also an opportunity for the public,
civil society, and the private sector to contribute ideas for how government
can achieve those goals.
A core requirement for OGP membership is that a two year National Action Plan
is developed publicly and transparently. The Australian Government invites you
to co-develop a vision and strategy for further progressing open government in
Australia, a strategy that outlines:
    * A vision for the future;
    * The history and status of open government in Australia;
    * Commitments to support the vision;
    * How government and the broader society can work together in achieving the
      vision; and
    * Ways to monitor and measure success.
The Australian Government’s OGP National Action Plan is expected to comply with
the Open_Government_Partnership_requirements. There is valuable guidance in the
Action Plans of other countries, such as the United_States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Indonesia. You can also review the full_list_of_OGP_countries on
the OGP site. You can read more about Australia’s engagement with OGP on the
OGP_Au_Background_page.
To contribute to the consultation, simply participate in the current
consultation stage. The National_Action_Plan_page outlines how each stage works
and how to contribute. We prefer public contributions to keep the conversation
open, so please also help in the peer review of ideas put forward throughout
the process.
We look forward to working with you on this exciting initiative.
