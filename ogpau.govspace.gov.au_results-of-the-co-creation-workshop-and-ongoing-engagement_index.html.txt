****** Results of the co-creation workshop and ongoing engagement ******
Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye
Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.

Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.

      Hi,
      I am the Chief Advisor to the CEO of the City of Adelaide and we are keen
      to explore how we can be involved in Australian Open Government
      Partnership Network ? Is there a key contact person we could chat to, as
      the international movement fits very closely with our Smart City
      strategic plan.
