<div class="entry-content">

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for
Australia’s first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government.
Stakeholders from civil society and Government came together in Canberra
to discuss suggest actions, prioritise them and draft commitment
templates. It was momentous day. Our agenda was ambitious and the
results excellent. We were productive because of the goodwill and hard
work of those in the room.

I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants
in both civil society and government. The team leading development of
the NAP at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have
are pleased with the event, participation and the outputs generated.

**Participants in the co-creation workshop**\
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the
workshop. Participants included:

-   36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open
    Gov actions
-   4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
    Transformation
-   15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital
    Transformation Office; Department of Finance; National Archives;
    Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
-   1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
-   The Information Commissioner from NSW
-   2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
-   2 from State Governments
-   2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process

**Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates**\
Participants at the workshop discussed the [210 actions suggested by
civil society](../category/submissions/index.html) and those suggested
by agencies through the [InterDepartmental Committee
(IDC).](../second-idc/index.html)Actions were grouped into 18 proposals
which were then prioritised by participants and turned into 14
commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of the workshop and details of
attendees are available on [this page of the
wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=ace219a644fa786aeac66dd71aafacc1)

**What happens next?**\
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated
to lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the
NAP and these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP
before it is submitted to the OGP in July.

See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan [on this
wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667)

**Ongoing engagement for OGPAU**\
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might
be managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored
opportunities for ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have
been recorded on [this page of the
wiki,](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cbe9cf80d51d9a1742b8d0b6dd54d676)and
we would like to invite those of you not in the room to contribute to
this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a commitment
around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my
engagement report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so
we can use it in our recommendations.

**Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia**\
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support
Unit and I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government
across Australia. The [Australian Open Government Partnership
Network](https://opengovernment.org.au/) (civil society) also
coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government
in Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.

I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in
this process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C
and I have been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the
commitment you have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an
honour getting to know you all and learning more about your work.
Throughout this project I have been capturing [what I have learned about
Open Government in
Australia.](../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html#comment-373)
This input will also be included in my engagement report in late May. 
Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to
include.

To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance
Open Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details
with PM&C, the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams
coordinating Open Government in State Government, and others in Civil
Society keen to connect with you on this topic. If you would like to
provide consent for any or all of these uses of your personal
information, please complete [this 2 minute
survey](https://app.surveygizmo.com/builder/build/id/2719702) so I know
who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the 14th
May.

    Hi,\
    I am the Chief Advisor to the CEO of the City of Adelaide and we are
    keen to explore how we can be involved in Australian Open Government
    Partnership Network ? Is there a key contact person we could chat
    to, as the international movement fits very closely with our Smart
