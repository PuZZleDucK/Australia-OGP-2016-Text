Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open
Government have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested
actions on the [wiki](../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html). This marks
the end of [Stage 2 of our engagement
process](../contribute/index.html), which was designed to raise
awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31^st^ March.

We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and
organisations. The level of investment of those who participated in this
process has been really impressive and the insight and experience of
participants is evident in the quality of submissions we received. There
is considerable passion and commitment to open government from our
community.

We have now commenced [Stage 3](../contribute/index.html)of the process
to develop the National Action Plan (NAP) and are working with those who
suggested actions to prioritise them and draft the NAP document.
Individuals and organisations who suggested an action have now been
invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in Canberra this
Monday, the 11^th^ April 2016.

During this workshop participants will work together to develop the
National Action Plan, completing [commitment
templates](../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html){.broken_link}
provided by the international[Open Government
Partnership.](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)Representatives from
civil society and government agencies will discuss all suggested actions
so they can be grouped and prioritised. Two members of the International
Open Government Partnership Support Unit will also be at the workshop to
lend their support with this process.

This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC)
meeting to discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government
initiatives to include in the background section and build upon, and the
priorities of government agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the
workshop. On Wednesday, this
[wiki](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667)
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and
methodology sections of the National Action Plan document. A [blog
update](../category/updates/index.html) was also sent out by PM&C to
share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to
submissions received and from their own research and analysis.

During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy
Secretary of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime
Minister and Cabinet and representatives of various Federal Government
Departments about how Open Government is being implemented in Australia
and government priorities for the NAP.

All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but
the National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a
suggested action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support
on Monday to co-create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to
brief nominated lead agencies about them after the event.

The agenda for this workshop is available
[here](../files/2016/04/Agenda-cocreation-workshop.pdf). The opening of
this workshop will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 –
10:15am so you can see the opening and ask questions of our speakers.
[Here is the link to the GoogeHangout](https://t.co/TrhH6d1aZc)– a
public event anyone can attend online.

We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process
after the workshop next week.
