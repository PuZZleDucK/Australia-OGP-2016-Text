****** Stage three: prioritisation and drafting workshop ******
Posted on April_9,_2016  by  amelialoye
Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government
have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the wiki.
This marks the end of Stage_2_of_our_engagement_process, which was designed to
raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31st March.
We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations.
The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.
