CDATA[With regard to models for such an enterprise, I can only endorse the NZ
comparison and strongly recommend that you look at the UK initiatives in
relation to open government and open data. Placing the open data strategy
within the ambit of the National Archives. along with Her Majestys' Stationery
Office, focuses on government information across all sectors - creation, use,
reuse and preservation. http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/united-

CDATA[Hi Alysha - I just noticed this comment had no response. State and
Territories are also welcome to submit their own applications to join the sub-
national pilot program recently introduced by the International Open Government
Partnership: <http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/subnational-
government-pilot-program". I am engaging with State Government Open Government
teams across the Country, inviting them to submit an action to the National
Action Plan. I have been in touch with Gail from Premiers in SA. I'll send you
an email so you have my contact details too. Amelia]]>

CDATA[How are State and Territory Governments able to participate in the Open
Government Partnership? Will the Action Plan seek to identify actions specific
to State and Territories Governments? What about Local Council?]]>

CDATA[Hi Pia, As I mentioned above public services would be improved by cutting
Commonwealth Public servant numbers. With nothing useful to do the redundant
public servants hold endless talkfests and suggest and impose layers of
regulations that suffocate private companies from growing GDP,growing
employment and being productive. For example. why does the Commonwealth have
4000 plus servants in the department of Health and Ageing which is really a
state responsibility? This is why Australia is heading inevitably into a 2016
recession despite excessive government spending temporarily propping up the
economy.]]>

CDATA[Hi Bill, thanks for the comment but it is worth noting that there is no
national action plan at this stage, it is being developed over the coming 5
months, so we are curious about what you are commenting on. If you have any
specific ideas about how to improve open government, please feel free to
contribute to the consultation. Warm regards, Pia Waugh]]>

CDATA[This national action plan is so convoluted and intangible it reads like a
Greens initiative . All flourishes but completely hollow. To advance Australia
our bloated commonwealth and state public servants must be drastically reduced
in number. The Australian newspaper`s research today showed their employment
conditions to be so much better than the private sector. Furthermore overseas
studies show that for every public or quasi public sector job create between
three to six jobs are lost in the private secots due to subsequent regulations
and costs. Turnbull`s failure to cut or at least freeze service numbers
indicates an unbelievable oversight or psychological capture by the Canberrs
public service. Real actions not grandiose statements are needed as we plunge
further down the steepening deficit slope.]]>

CDATA[I can't help but be extremely wary of this process. Having been involved
in Senate Inquiries that achieve absolutely nothing in the past, even though
the majority want change. I can't see myself wasting time doing submissions
that achieve nothing! Australia's financial position is deteriorating quickly
and it is unlikely the government can pick winners. Private enterprise is the
only thing that can save our country, a National Action Plan run by Government
won't achieve much at all. Government just needs to get out of the way, but
they won't until the economy collapses or the global bankers turn the money
off?]]>

CDATA[I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational principle of
engaging civil society in government decision-making. This is increasing being
demonstrated in social purpose programs where those the programs are intended
to impact are engaged in the decisions on the design, delivery and evaluation
of those programs. However, I am surprised that the current engagement for
gaining membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in
four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately disengages
and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil society. It is those
most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by this approach to
âengagementâ]]>
