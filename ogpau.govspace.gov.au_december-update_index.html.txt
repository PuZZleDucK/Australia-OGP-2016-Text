<div class="entry-content">

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the
Open Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in
Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation,
enthusiasm and contribution to the development of the Australian
Government’s National Action Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.

As a result of the discussions at these face to face information
sessions, we have created an email address
([ogp@pmc.gov.au](http://ogp@pmc.gov.au/)) as an additional
communication and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who
feel less comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using
the wikispaces.  Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via
this address and you can be assured that, at no time, will a single
contribution, suggestion or feedback be directly attributed to a person
or an organisation.

Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are
able to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan
([https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/](../faqs/index.html)).

As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would
encourage all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting
their suggestions.  Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP
principles of: Transparency; Accountability; Participation; Technology;
and/or Innovation.  Submissions should also consider implementation
options and potential ways that progress can be measured.

There are a wealth of resources located
at <http://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/landing> which provide
details of the existing commitments developed by other countries in
their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that have been
through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom of
this email for more information on how to contribute.

Updates from the coordination team
----------------------------------

As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she
will be finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity
leave.  As a result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of
National Action Plan Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation
process over the course of the next 6 months.  I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Pia for her tireless dedication to the OGP process
she will be greatly missed, but has assured us that she will be keeping
an eye from afar.

I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the
design and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2
(drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (running the Community
Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once the outcome of this process is
known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.

Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over
the coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between
Christmas and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog,
twitter and email) will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send
out another email in January updating you on the consultation process
and providing more details on the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

    I am a co-convenor of Ican, the Independent Community Accountability
    Network, an organisation dedicated to engaging members of the public
    in active, non-partisan support for the principle of public office,
    public trust.

    Ican promotes and is an advocate of a corruption free government of
    integrity and accountability. The organization is concerned that
    members of the community take an active interest in, and
    responsibility for, the quality of its own democracy.\
