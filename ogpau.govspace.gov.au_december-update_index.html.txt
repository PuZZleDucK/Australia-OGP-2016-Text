****** An update from the coordination team, and a reminder to contribute to
Stage 2 ******
Posted on December_22,_2015  by  Helen_Owens
I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

      I am a co-convenor of Ican, the Independent Community Accountability
      Network, an organisation dedicated to engaging members of the public in
      active, non-partisan support for the principle of public office, public
      trust.
      Ican promotes and is an advocate of a corruption free government of
      integrity and accountability. The organization is concerned that members
      of the community take an active interest in, and responsibility for, the
      quality of its own democracy.
