2.2 – Build and maintain public trust to address concerns about data sharing {#build-and-maintain-public-trust-to-address-concerns-about-data-sharing .entry-title}
============================================================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will develop an ongoing and collaborative conversation with the
community to build public trust around data sharing and integration.*

**Objective\
**Australia will actively engage with the community regarding how public
data is being used to provide more targeted and effective policy,
service delivery and program evaluation.

**Status Quo\
**In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, effective policy
responses require investment in joined-up data that can provide a strong
evidence-base for policy decisions.

The New Zealand Government has invested in both a whole-of-government
Integrated Data Infrastructure and enhanced analytical capability with
positive results in terms of reduced government spending and improved
public policy outcomes in areas such as human rights, law enforcement,
health, education and justice.

While the Australian Public Service (APS) has made some progress in this
area, we need to better inform the community about the benefits of data
sharing and address public concerns, including perceived values, risks,
and attitudes towards privacy.

The Privacy Act 1988 underpins the open data agenda and helps build
public trust in data-sharing activities. The Government has introduced a
Bill to amend the Act to make it an offence to deliberately re-identify
personal information from open government data.

Data literacy across the APS is also critical. In August 2016, the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet released Data Skills and
Capability in the Australian Public Service to help build skills and
knowledge in publishing, linking and sharing public data.

**Ambition\
**To build trust about the use of integrated data and actively respond
to community concerns about data sharing. To comply with international
best practice on open data principles and participate in global fora on
data.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **transparency** and
**public** **participation** by:

-   providing greater transparency on how government is using the data
    it collects and protecting personal information;
-   enabling the community to engage with government and raise issues of
    concern;
-   enabling experts outside of government to inform public debate; and
-   providing more targeted and effective policy, service delivery and
    program evaluation.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   Improving Public Services
-   Increasing Public Integrity

**Timeframes\
**December 2016 – End 2017

**Lead agency\
**Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Australian Bureau of
Statistics and Office of the Australian Information Commissioner

**Other actors involved**\
*Government:  *Attorney General’s Department, Treasury, Fair Work
Ombudsman, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Department of
Social Services, Department of Industry, Innovation and Science and
Department of Health, Department of Human Services, Australian Taxation
Office and Australian Federal Police

*Non-government:* Open Data Institute Queensland and digital rights
organisation
