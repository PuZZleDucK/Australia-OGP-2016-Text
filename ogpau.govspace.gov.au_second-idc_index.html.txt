On Tuesday 5 April, the Government convened a second interdepartmental
committee (IDC) meeting on the Open Government Partnership. The meeting
covered the public submissions received to date, discussed attendance at
the public workshop to be held on Monday 11 April, and talked more
broadly about the Open Government Partnership process going forward, and
how agencies will be involved.

In attendance were:

-   Attorney-General’s Department
-   Australian Bureau of Statistics
-   Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
-   Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
-   Australian Public Service Commission
-   Department of Education and Training
-   Department of Employment
-   Department of Finance
-   Department of Health
-   Department of Human Services
-   Department of Immigration and Border Protection
-   Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
-   Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
-   Department of the Environment
-   Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
-   Digital Transformation Office
-   National Archives of Australia
-   Office of the Australian Information Commissioner

Also discussed at the meeting were a range of potential commitments that
the Agencies have come up with either in response to submissions
received, or from their own research and analysis.

The outlines of these are below, and they will be open for discussion at
the public workshop.

-   Centralised Annual Report discovery portal
-   Create a Digital Marketplace
-   Create, manage and preserve information digitally
-   Enable and encourage more data-driven digital report publishing
-   Future-proofing open data infrastructure
-   Grants.gov.au redevelopment
-   ICT Project dashboard
-   Redesign the open data request process
-   Scoping a public consultation platform
-   Scoping an e-Tabling system
-   Transforming high volume services

In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the
commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki
and other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy
to read, in line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is
available for download at [National Action Plan DRAFT v5 – For
Release](../files/2016/04/National-Action-Plan-DRAFT-v5-For-Release.docx)

We have also posted the text onto the wiki at
[http://ogpau.wikispaces.com/Draft+text+of+the+National+Action+Plan+-+5+April+2016](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667) for
your comments and feedback prior to the meeting on Monday.

    I have been running a survey over the past months of attitudes and
    concerns regarding transparency and accountability in Australia. The
    survey asks people to tick their concerns, share the tools and
    resources the use to investigate accountability issues and also
    offer their own ideas for how to improve transparency in Australia.\
    The overview is at <https://infoaus.net/openaus/ideas.php>\
    Results for individual questions can be found at
