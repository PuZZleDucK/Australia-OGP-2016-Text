****** Register to attend an OGP Australia information session ******
Posted on November_30,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh
To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.
The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:
Brisbane:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)

Canberra:            16 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time) LIVE STREAMED

event
Melbourne:          17 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-melbourne-information-session.eventbrite.com
Please note: the Brisbane session is being run immediately prior to an Open
Data Institute Queensland event, hence the timing and shortened session.
