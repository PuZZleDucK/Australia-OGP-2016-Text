****** Introduction ******
Australia is a successful and stable democracy, with relatively low levels of
corruption and a long, proud history of open government.
In 2015, we were ranked 13th in Transparency International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index, and 9th in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy
Index.
But in a rapidly changing world – transformed by the digital revolution – it is
important Australia boosts its efforts to become even more open, transparent
and accountable, and improve public engagement. This is crucial as we seek to:
    * build a better society for all Australians and be more responsive to the
      expectations of the community;
    * stimulate economic growth and innovation;
    * foster collaboration between government, business, academia, non-
      government organisations and the community; and
    * continue efforts to stamp out corruption, fraud and misconduct.
Governments worldwide are moving towards more open and transparent ways of
working, with 70 countries – including Australia – now signed up to the Open
Government Partnership.
***** What is the Open Government Partnership? *****
The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative established in
2011 that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote
transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies
to strengthen governance.
Membership requires governments to work with civil society to ‘co-create’ a
National Action Plan every two years, with independent reporting on progress.
Civil society is a term used by the Partnership to broadly refer to people and
organisations outside of government, including non government organisations,
business, academia, community groups and the public.
Importantly, the Open Government Partnership doesn’t prescribe standards that
countries should follow – rather it aims to bring governments and citizens of
each country together to define their own priorities for reform.
The Australian Government confirmed its membership of the Open Government
Partnership in November 2015.
This National Action Plan sets out the initial steps the Government will take
to achieve the aim of improving and building confidence in Australian
institutions and democracy, and to uphold the principles in the Open Government
Declaration, including to:
    * promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the
      power of new technologies to make government more effective and
      accountable;
    * uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve
      services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer
      communities; and
    * embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward
      achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own
      country and in an increasingly interconnected world.
The Plan sets out an agenda for the next two years across a broad range of
important areas:
    * Transparency_and_accountability_in_business
    * Open_data_and_digital_transformation
    * Access_to_government_information
    * Integrity_in_the_public_sector
    * Public_participation_and_engagement
As our first National Action Plan, it provides a foundation to continue
engaging with civil society to identify new initiatives and strengthen our
efforts over time. There is also an opportunity going forward to work with
state, territory and local governments to improve transparency and integrity at
all levels of government.
