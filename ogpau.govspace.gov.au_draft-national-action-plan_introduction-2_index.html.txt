Introduction {#introduction .entry-title}
============

<div class="entry-content">

Australia is a successful and stable democracy, with relatively low
levels of corruption and a long, proud history of open government.

In 2015, we were ranked 13^th^ in Transparency International’s
Corruption Perceptions Index, and 9^th^ in The Economist Intelligence
Unit’s Democracy Index.

But in a rapidly changing world – transformed by the digital revolution
– it is important Australia boosts its efforts to become even more open,
transparent and accountable, and improve public engagement. This is
crucial as we seek to:

-   build a better society for all Australians and be more responsive to
    the expectations of the community;
-   stimulate economic growth and innovation;
-   foster collaboration between government, business, academia,
    non-government organisations and the community; and
-   continue efforts to stamp out corruption, fraud and misconduct.

Governments worldwide are moving towards more open and transparent ways
of working, with 70 countries – including Australia – now signed up to
the Open Government Partnership.

What is the Open Government Partnership?
----------------------------------------

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative established
in 2011 that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to
promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness
new technologies to strengthen governance.

Membership requires governments to work with civil society to
‘co-create’ a National Action Plan every two years, with independent
reporting on progress. Civil society is a term used by the Partnership
to broadly refer to people and organisations outside of government,
including non government organisations, business, academia, community
groups and the public.

Importantly, the Open Government Partnership doesn’t prescribe standards
that countries should follow – rather it aims to bring governments and
citizens of each country together to define their own priorities for
reform.

The Australian Government confirmed its membership of the Open
Government Partnership in November 2015.

This National Action Plan sets out the initial steps the Government will
take to achieve the aim of improving and building confidence in
Australian institutions and democracy, and to uphold the principles in
the Open Government Declaration, including to:

-   promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and
    harness the power of new technologies to make government more
    effective and accountable;
-   uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to
    improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and
    create safer communities; and
-   embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view
    toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity
    in our own country and in an increasingly interconnected world.

The Plan sets out an agenda for the next two years across a broad range
of important areas:

-   [Transparency and accountability in
    business](../commitments/theme-1-transparency-and-accountability-in-business/index.html)
-   [Open data and digital
    transformation](../commitments/theme-2-open-data-and-digital-transformation/index.html)
-   [Access to government
    information](../commitments/theme-3-access-to-government-information/index.html)
-   [Integrity in the public
    sector](../commitments/theme-4-integrity-in-the-public-sector/index.html)
-   [Public participation and
    engagement](../commitments/theme-5-public-participation-and-engagement/index.html)

As our first National Action Plan, it provides a foundation to continue
engaging with civil society to identify new initiatives and strengthen
our efforts over time. There is also an opportunity going forward to
work with state, territory and local governments to improve transparency
and integrity at all levels of government.
