this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help

(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.

transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group

attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and

Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
