1.2 – Beneficial ownership {#beneficial-ownership .entry-title}
==========================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will consult with the corporate sector, non-government organisations
and the public on a beneficial ownership register for companies.*

**Objective\
**Australia will work to improve transparency of information on
beneficial ownership and control of companies available to competent
authorities.

**Status Quo\
**Improving transparency around who owns and benefits from financial
arrangements is key to protecting the integrity of our financial systems
and preventing the misuse of financial entities for corruption and
criminal activity. A beneficial ownership register shows who ultimately
benefits from the activities of companies.

Australia currently has tracing powers for beneficial ownership of
listed companies and investment schemes but there is room to strengthen
these provisions.

**Ambition\
**To ensure that adequate, accurate and timely information on beneficial
ownership and control is available to competent authorities in
Australia.

To improve regional and international cooperation on taxation, including
strengthening information sharing between tax authorities and sharing
learnings to increase the transparency of beneficial ownership
information. We will use outcomes of the work by the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of
Information for Tax Purposes this year to help develop proposals to
improve implementation of relevant international standards on
transparency, including on the availability and exchange of companies’
beneficial ownership information.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **access to
information** and public accountability by:

-   improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and
    institutional frameworks;
-   preventing the misuse of financial arrangements for illicit purposes
    such as corruption, tax evasion and money laundering;
-   protecting the integrity of the financial system; and
-   increasing growth through private sector investment.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   Increasing Corporate Accountability

**Timeframes\
**Recommendation to Government on improving transparency of information
on beneficial ownership of companies available to competent authorities
by end 2017

**Lead agency\
**Treasury

**Other actors involved**\
*Government:* Attorney General’s Department , Australian Securities and
Investment Commission, G20, Australian Taxation Office, regional
partners and Australian Accounting Standards Board

*Non-government:* Companies, non-government organisations, reporting
entities under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing
Act, FATF, Global Forum, international tax partners

**Milestones**

1.  Release a public consultation paper seeking views on the details,
    scope and implementation of a register of beneficial ownership
    of companies. The consultation will also consider:1) Recommendations
    by FATF and the Global Forum on proposals to improve the
    implementation of the international standards on transparency,
    including on the availability of beneficial ownership information
    and its international exchange.2) The use of nominee shareholdings
    to conceal beneficial ownership, including potential solutions.
    -   End 2016

2.  Public consultation
    -   End 2016 – Early 2017

3.  Recommendation to Government on the details, scope and
    implementation of a register of beneficial ownership of companies.
    -   Mid 2017

4.  Recommendation to Government on other related areas of beneficial
    ownership transparency considered during consultation.
    -   End 2017
