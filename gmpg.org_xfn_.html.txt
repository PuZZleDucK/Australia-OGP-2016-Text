Xhtml Friends Network
=====================

XFN™ (**X**HTML **F**riends **N**etwork) is a simple way to represent
human relationships using hyperlinks. In recent years,
[blogs](http://www.technorati.com/help/blogging101.html "Hyperlink to a definition of the term 'blog' and related terms.")
and
[blogrolls](http://www.microcontentnews.com/resources/glossary/blogrolling.htm "Hyperlink to a definition of the term 'blogrolling'")
have become the fastest growing area of the Web. XFN enables web authors
to indicate their relationship(s) to the people in their blogrolls
simply by adding a '`rel`' attribute to their
`<a href>`{title="hyperlink anchor"} tags, e.g.:

`<a href="http://jeff.example.org" rel="friend met">...`{.eg}
