http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/?p=546\#comment-459 Hi, I am the Chief
Advisor to the CEO of the City of Adelaide and we are keen to explore
how we can be involved in Australian Open Government Partnership Network
? Is there a key contact person we could chat to, as the international
movement fits very closely with our Smart City strategic plan. Steve
