http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/?p=383\#comment-318 Thanks Peter, I
understand. I just want to ensure we make the most of the time we have.
I have seen some people commenting on others suggestions on the wiki and
want to encourage more of that kind of three way engagement. As stated,
I thought it would be useful to introduce everyone making submissions
before they close on Thursday, and before the event in Canberra on the
11th. I understand not everyone will be able to make these times,
particularly given the short notice and time of year. These events have
been designed, responsively, to complement engagement through the wiki
and the email invitations are an introduction to further engage with
each other. I will also post the notes from each teleconference under
themes to encourage more ongoing discussion online. Amelia

http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/?p=383\#comment-308 Hi Amelia, I understand
and welcome the sentiments behind your initiative to facilitate dialogue
before the government run event on 11 April between those who have
submitted suggestions for commitments on the same theme. But to receive
an invitation on Thursday before Easter to participate in
teleconferences at nominated times on Tuesday and Wednesday, the first
days after the Easter break, is unlikely to lead to optimal engagement.
Tuesday is a shocker for me personally although I will give it a shake
including 1530-1630 the times allocated for Freedom of Information, a
topic especially important to me and in the scheme of things, a subject
of central importance when we are talking about reforms to advance open
transparent government. Another member of the Network, one of
Australia&\#039;s leading authorities on access to information issues
tells me he is away over the break including these days when he will be
remote from any opportunity to participate. The Australian Open
Govenment Partnership Network and its members are interested in the full
range of themes but our resources are such that dropping everything to
participate over two days at such short notice is just not possible.
Sure we can attempt to connect up ourselves but the limited notice at
this time of the year-the most &\#039;away&\#039; time on the Australian
calendar- shouldn&\#039;t go unremarked. &lt;p&gt;Hi Amelia,&lt;br /&gt;
