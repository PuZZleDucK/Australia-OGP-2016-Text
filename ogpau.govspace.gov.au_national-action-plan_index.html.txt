Preparing the National Action Plan {#preparing-the-national-action-plan .entry-title}
==================================

<div class="entry-content">

The [Open Government
Partnership](../contact-colophon/index.html "Read more about the Open Government Partnership")
(OGP) requires broad consultation for the development of member
countries’ National Action Plans (NAP). This provides the public, civil
society, and the private sector with the opportunity to participate in
the process, and suggest commitments for governments to undertake.

As described in the consultation process timeline below, the Government
will use the prioritised public-suggested commitments to guide the
development of a draft NAP. Contributions for the NAP will be considered
in the context of what will improve public services and improve
management of public resources, as well as what will benefit the public,
provide opportunities for business and support innovation in Australia.

We look forward to your contributions to the consultation and public
discussions. We encourage you to contribute throughout the process and,
as this is a public consultation process, we prefer all contributions to
be made publicly for transparency and peer review.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead
Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and
will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&C
will work with other agencies across the Australian Public Service and
other jurisdictions within Australia to develop the NAP, including
public consultation, to support this work. We are keen to have
representation and ideas from all parts of society, including civil
society, industry, academia, cultural sectors, and from different areas
of government in Australia.

You can subscribe to the [OGP Au mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P)
for updates and news. Alternatively you can get website updates with the
[OGP Au RSS feed](../feed/index.html). We will be reporting progress on
a regular basis.

Thank you in advance for your contributions, and in helping to shape
Australia’s first submission to the OGP.

Structure of the National Action Plan
-------------------------------------

The OGP advises that a country’s NAP should consist of 5-15
recommendations, draw on at least one of the five ‘grand challenges’
defined by the OGP, and address defined National Action Plan Principles.

### Open Government Partnership ‘Grand Challenges’

NAPs are developed drawing on at least one of the five ‘grand
challenges’ defined by the OGP:

-   **Improving Public Services** – measures that address the full
    spectrum of citizen services including health, education, criminal
    justice, water, electricity, telecommunications, and any other
    relevant service areas by fostering public service improvement or
    private sector innovation**;**
-   **Increasing Public Integrity** – measures that address corruption
    and public ethics,\
    access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil
    society\
    freedom;
-   **More Effectively Managing Public Resources** – measures that
    address budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign
    assistance;
-   **Creating Safer Communities** – measures that address public
    safety, the security\
    sector, disaster and crisis response, and environmental threats; and
-   I**ncreasing Corporate Accountability** – measures that address
    corporate\
    responsibility on issues such as the environment, anti-corruption,
    consumer\
    protection, and community engagement.

### National Action Plan Principles

Each of the commitments made under an NAP must address at least one of
the following principles laid out by the OGP, so please consider these
when making your contributions.

-   **Transparency**: Publication of government-held information;
    proactive or reactive releases of information; mechanisms to
    strengthen the right to and open access to information.
-   **Accountability:** The rules, regulations and mechanisms in place
    that call upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon
    criticisms or requirements made of them, and accept responsibility
    for failure to perform with respect to laws or commitments**.**
    Ideally these should include the public.
-   **Participation:** Mobilisation of citizens on government policies
    or programs to provide input or feedback and make contributions that
    lead to more responsive, innovative and effective governance.
-   **Technology and Innovation:** Providing citizens with open access
    to and capability with technology for greater innovation. To be
    relevant to OGP, these initiatives must advance government
    transparency, accountability and/or public participation.

    With regard to models for such an enterprise, I can only endorse the
    NZ comparison and strongly recommend that you look at the UK
    initiatives in relation to open government and open data. Placing
    the open data strategy within the ambit of the National Archives.

        State and Territories are also welcome to submit their own

        &lt;<http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/subnational-government-pilot-program&quot>;.\
        I am engaging with State Government Open Government teams across

        Action Plan. I have been in touch with Gail from Premiers in

    This national action plan is so convoluted and intangible it reads
    like a Greens initiative . All flourishes but completely hollow.\
    To advance Australia our bloated commonwealth and state public
    servants must be drastically reduced in number. The Australian
    newspaper\`s research today showed their employment conditions to be
    so much better than the private sector.\
    Furthermore overseas studies show that for every public or quasi
    public sector job create between three to six jobs are lost in the
    private secots due to subsequent regulations and costs.\
    Turnbull\`s failure to cut or at least freeze service numbers
    indicates an unbelievable oversight or psychological capture by the
    Canberrs public service.\
    Real actions not grandiose statements are needed as we plunge
    further down the steepening deficit slope.

        Hi Bill, thanks for the comment but it is worth noting that
        there is no national action plan at this stage, it is being
        developed over the coming 5 months, so we are curious about what
        you are commenting on. If you have any specific ideas about how
        to improve open government, please feel free to contribute to
        the consultation.

            Hi Pia,\
            As I mentioned above public services would be improved by
            cutting Commonwealth Public servant numbers. With nothing
            useful to do the redundant public servants hold endless
            talkfests and suggest and impose layers of regulations that
            suffocate private companies from growing GDP,growing
            employment and being productive. For example. why does the
            Commonwealth have 4000 plus servants in the department of
            Health and Ageing which is really a state responsibility?\
            This is why Australia is heading inevitably into a 2016
            recession despite excessive government spending temporarily
            propping up the economy.

    I can’t help but be extremely wary of this process.\
    Having been involved in Senate Inquiries that achieve absolutely
    nothing in the past, even though the majority want change. I can’t
    see myself wasting time doing submissions that achieve nothing!\
    Australia’s financial position is deteriorating quickly and it is
    unlikely the government can pick winners. Private enterprise is the
    only thing that can save our country, a National Action Plan run by
    Government won’t achieve much at all. Government just needs to get
    out of the way, but they won’t until the economy collapses or the
    global bankers turn the money off?

    I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
    membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational
    principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making.
    This is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs
    where those the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the
    decisions on the design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.\
    However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining
    membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session
    in four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately
    disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of
    civil society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted
    most by this approach to ‘engagement’

    Doing away with the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) sounds like a
    crazy idea. But the UK Cabinet Secretary, Francis Maude in 2010
    spoke about the hope of open data will remove the need for the FoI
    Act because “people won’t have to ask”. I think this is a very good
    premise to start with.

    Conservative think-tank, Policy Exchange, in a 2012 report said
    better use of data, technology and analytics could help the UK
    government save billions by improving efficiency rather than
    cutting services. It predicts the “data force” could save taxpayers
    up to £33bn per year. Not only could it save taxpayers money, it
    could improve public policy and importantly improve accountability
    and transparency of government decisions.

    In 2010 David Cameron campaigned on improving transparency
    and accountability. And in 2011 I was working at the Home Office at
    the time when they launched street-level crime maps, showing exactly
    what crimes had been committed across the whole of England
    and Wales. This example typifies what big data can achieve and one
    that goes to improving transparency and accountability.

    In the UK, every Secretary, Minister, political staffer and senior
    civil servant must publish details of meetings with external
    organisations, gifts (given and received), hospitality and overseas
    travel on a quarterly basis. Also an initiative that would go a long
    way towards making the system more accountable and transparent
    to taxpayers.

    The FoI Act is a powerful tool for the public. But the Government
    has a bill before the Parliament that seeks to undermine and weaken
    the Act.

    The bill would abolish the Office of the Australian Information
    Commissioner, an independent final place of appeal for those seeking
    documents under the Act. In anticipation of tearing down the office
    the government has stripped it of its funding – a mere \$10.2
    million over four years. The office faces the bizarre situation of
    still being in existence but with no money. Appeals to the office
    cost nothing but the government wants to charge people to appeal to
    the Administrative Appeals Tribunal – this will cost \$861, plus
    legal advice and representation charges.

    This issue needs to be resolved before progressing the Open
    Government Partnership action plan. It is incompatible to have a
    bill before Parliament that seeks to undermine the very principles
    being set out in this important task.

    Contrast this with the US where two Senators from either side of
    politics have teamed up to strengthen their FoI Act. The Senate
    passed the bill by unanimous consent. It then was sent to the House
    of Representatives, which had already passed its own version of the
    reforms by an overwhelming vote of 410-0. Given the current
    political climate in the US to achieve such bipartisan agreement on
    anything is nothing short of a miracle. But it does show the
    importance both sides hold to appearing to improve accountability
    and transparency.

    I welcome this process and congratulate the Government for
    committing to develop a national action plan.

    Hi Pia,

    Just a couple of comments, now that we’re getting to the point of
    doing things globally.

    You’d appreciate that there’s a parallel org to the ogp – the civil
    society end of gov – so we’ll be able to give you some comparative
    feedback on how you go about building the Action plan.au.
    <http://www.ogphub.org/napreview-pilot/>

    Obviously one of the major products of these plans will developing
    is a “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (built around a citizen’s ID).
    So we can expect (with your imagination) that ad hoc/buckshot
    approaches like the gov 2.0 taskforce will start firming up into a
    platform which may be used by gov, and civil society, groups around
    the world. <http://open4m.org/about-us/>

    You’re very lucky to have many existing groups of correspondents in
    various countries already that span between the internal groups of a
    government and the civil society groups with which they
    coordinate “actions”. e.g.
    <http://forum.opengovernment.org.uk/groups/ogp>

    One more note as you say “NZ and other governments have generally
    established their groups after getting the national action
    plan developed”. That’s not what they are telling others. “New
    Zealand (as one) is in the process of setting up a Stakeholder
    Advisory Group to assist with developing, implementing and
    evaluating their plans”.
    <http://www.ogphub.org/blog/advancing-ogp-in-asia-pacific/>

    Personally I prefer the way you’re going about it – keeping
    things open. As Shreya (your OGP contact in Singapore) says in the
    doc above, “The important thing now is to sustain the positive
    momentum generated by OGP and create permanent dialogue mechanisms,
    with clear terms of reference, representation drawn from groups that
    go beyond the ‘usual suspects’ and regular meetings to strengthen
    the impact of the OGP process on government-civil society engagement
    and to mitigate against risks posed by changes in leadership.”

    “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (as the English call it). “Permanent
    Dialogue Mechanism”, “Knowledge Exchange”; call it what you want.
    That’s one deliverable which every gov wants delivered before the
    “action” really starts.

    Pia, great to see the initiative. Congratulations all round. And
    your response on this blog is also, IMO exemplary. What I’m talking
    about is the flavour of talking to an intelligent being with
    thoughts and responses capable of conveying personal inclinations
    and values without expressing them in anodyne form until they’ve
    been run up the line for approval. The kind of thing that we tried
    to model in the Government 2.0 Taskforce. It’s been a long time.

        Hi Nicholas – It has been a long time, but as you say – great to
        see this initiative. Congrats to Pia and all.

        For me open government is a very human endeavour so your
        comments on how we talk makes perfect sense.

        Would it (what we write and say), pass the pub test springs

    I echo Peter’s welcoming of the news – a fairly easy decision to
    make that took way to long to make.

    First step is to amend the Administrative Arrangements Order to
    ensure that Freedom of Information comes under the purview of the
    Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

    This is welcome news, and appreciate the thought that has gone into
    design of consultative steps so far.

    Two comments.

    One, you state\
    “At this stage, it is envisioned that the first Australian
    Government’s NAP will focus on the two OGP grand challenges of:\
    • Improving Public Services – measures that address the full
    spectrum of citizen services including health, education, criminal
    justice, water, electricity, telecommunications, and any other
    relevant service areas by fostering public service improvement or
    private sector innovation; and\
    • More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address
    budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign assistance.”

    Many outside government might ponder the ‘envisioning’ without
    outside input that led to this choice of these two challenges from
    the five laid out by the OGP, leaving this challenge off the
    agenda:\
    “. Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and
    public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and
    media and civil society freedom.”

    Two, experience elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder
    group can enhance the partnership concept and add value. There is no
    mention of such a body in the published material. NZ, well into the
    process is just one of many countries that have now gone down this
    path.\
    <http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1508/S00042/advisory-group-for-open-government-partnership-appointed.htm>

    Looking forward to taking things forward.

        Thanks Peter for the feedback and support. Regarding the
        challenges chosen, for the first national action plan it seemed
        appropriate to kick off with a few specific ones but we have
        taken on your comment and will consult on the key themes for
        future national action plans. They are redone every two years.

        Regarding the advisory group, that sounds like a good idea to
        contribute as an action for the government to consider, so
        please add that suggestion to stage 2 of the consultation. NZ
        and other governments have generally established their groups
        after getting the national action plan developed, so in the
        meantime we will reach out and discuss the model with
        those jurisdictions.

            Hi Pia

            I agree, It does make sense to kick off with
            specific challenges. That being said I also think it makes
            sense to be prepared to highlight issues of culture, customs
            and practice where they pose significant risks to dealing
            with those challenges on there ground.

            I’d say those components would fall into three categories.
            Those that can be easily dealt with right away, those that
            can be spun off as short term project (1-3 months), and
            those that are of such significance that they would
            constitute a major new initiative by government. Or could
            easily be earmarked for inclusion in subsequent
            actions plans.

            I think the guiding light within that should be along the
            lines of speed and agility. Better than a lock step
            approach IMO.
