****** Preparing the National Action Plan ******
The Open_Government_Partnership (OGP) requires broad consultation for the
development of member countries’ National Action Plans (NAP). This provides the
public, civil society, and the private sector with the opportunity to
participate in the process, and suggest commitments for governments to
undertake.
As described in the consultation process timeline below, the Government will
use the prioritised public-suggested commitments to guide the development of a
draft NAP. Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of what
will improve public services and improve management of public resources, as
well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities for business and
support innovation in Australia.
We look forward to your contributions to the consultation and public
discussions. We encourage you to contribute throughout the process and, as this
is a public consultation process, we prefer all contributions to be made
publicly for transparency and peer review.
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead
Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and will
coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&C will work with
other agencies across the Australian Public Service and other jurisdictions
within Australia to develop the NAP, including public consultation, to support
this work. We are keen to have representation and ideas from all parts of
society, including civil society, industry, academia, cultural sectors, and
from different areas of government in Australia.
You can subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list for updates and news.
Alternatively you can get website updates with the OGP_Au_RSS_feed. We will be
reporting progress on a regular basis.
Thank you in advance for your contributions, and in helping to shape
Australia’s first submission to the OGP.
***** Structure of the National Action Plan *****
The OGP advises that a country’s NAP should consist of 5-15 recommendations,
draw on at least one of the five ‘grand challenges’ defined by the OGP, and
address defined National Action Plan Principles.
**** Open Government Partnership ‘Grand Challenges’ ****
NAPs are developed drawing on at least one of the five ‘grand challenges’
defined by the OGP:
    * Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of
      citizen services including health, education, criminal justice, water,
      electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by
      fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation;
    * Increasing Public Integrity– measures that address corruption and public
      ethics,
      access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil
      society
      freedom;
    * More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address
      budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign assistance;
    * Creating Safer Communities – measures that address public safety, the
      security
      sector, disaster and crisis response, and environmental threats; and
    * Increasing Corporate Accountability – measures that address corporate
      responsibility on issues such as the environment, anti-corruption,
      consumer
      protection, and community engagement.
**** National Action Plan Principles ****
Each of the commitments made under an NAP must address at least one of the
following principles laid out by the OGP, so please consider these when making
your contributions.
    * Transparency: Publication of government-held information; proactive or
      reactive releases of information; mechanisms to strengthen the right to
      and open access to information.
    * Accountability: The rules, regulations and mechanisms in place that call
      upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon criticisms or
      requirements made of them, and accept responsibility for failure to
      perform with respect to laws or commitments. Ideally these should include
      the public.
    * Participation: Mobilisation of citizens on government policies or
      programs to provide input or feedback and make contributions that lead to
      more responsive, innovative and effective governance.
    * Technology and Innovation:Providing citizens with open access to and
      capability with technology for greater innovation. To be relevant to OGP,
      these initiatives must advance government transparency, accountability
      and/or public participation.

      With regard to models for such an enterprise, I can only endorse the NZ
      comparison and strongly recommend that you look at the UK initiatives in
      relation to open government and open data. Placing the open data strategy
      within the ambit of the National Archives. along with Her Majestys’
      Stationery Office, focuses on government information across all sectors –
      creation, use, reuse and preservation.

      How are State and Territory Governments able to participate in the Open

            State and Territories are also welcome to submit their own
            applications to join the sub-national pilot program recently
            introduced by the International Open Government Partnership: <http:

            pilot-program&quot;.
            I am engaging with State Government Open Government teams across
            the Country, inviting them to submit an action to the National
            Action Plan. I have been in touch with Gail from Premiers in SA.
            I'll send you an email so you have my contact details too.

      This national action plan is so convoluted and intangible it reads like a
      Greens initiative . All flourishes but completely hollow.
      To advance Australia our bloated commonwealth and state public servants
      must be drastically reduced in number. The Australian newspaper`s
      research today showed their employment conditions to be so much better
      than the private sector.
      Furthermore overseas studies show that for every public or quasi public
      sector job create between three to six jobs are lost in the private
      secots due to subsequent regulations and costs.
      Turnbull`s failure to cut or at least freeze service numbers indicates an
      unbelievable oversight or psychological capture by the Canberrs public
      service.
      Real actions not grandiose statements are needed as we plunge further
      down the steepening deficit slope.

            Hi Bill, thanks for the comment but it is worth noting that there
            is no national action plan at this stage, it is being developed
            over the coming 5 months, so we are curious about what you are
            commenting on. If you have any specific ideas about how to improve
            open government, please feel free to contribute to the
            consultation.

                  Hi Pia,
                  As I mentioned above public services would be improved by
                  cutting Commonwealth Public servant numbers. With nothing
                  useful to do the redundant public servants hold endless
                  talkfests and suggest and impose layers of regulations that
                  suffocate private companies from growing GDP,growing
                  employment and being productive. For example. why does the
                  Commonwealth have 4000 plus servants in the department of
                  Health and Ageing which is really a state responsibility?
                  This is why Australia is heading inevitably into a 2016
                  recession despite excessive government spending temporarily
                  propping up the economy.

      I can’t help but be extremely wary of this process.
      Having been involved in Senate Inquiries that achieve absolutely nothing
      in the past, even though the majority want change. I can’t see myself
      wasting time doing submissions that achieve nothing!
      Australia’s financial position is deteriorating quickly and it is
      unlikely the government can pick winners. Private enterprise is the only
      thing that can save our country, a National Action Plan run by Government
      won’t achieve much at all. Government just needs to get out of the way,
      but they won’t until the economy collapses or the global bankers turn the
      money off?

      I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
      membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational
      principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This
      is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those
      the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the
      design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.
      However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining
      membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in
      four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately
      disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil
      society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by
      this approach to ‘engagement’

      Doing away with the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) sounds like a crazy
      idea. But the UK Cabinet Secretary, Francis Maude in 2010 spoke about the
      hope of open data will remove the need for the FoI Act because “people
      won’t have to ask”. I think this is a very good premise to start with.
      Conservative think-tank, Policy Exchange, in a 2012 report said better
      use of data, technology and analytics could help the UK government save
      billions by improving efficiency rather than cutting services. It
      predicts the “data force” could save taxpayers up to £33bn per year. Not
      only could it save taxpayers money, it could improve public policy and
      importantly improve accountability and transparency of government
      decisions.
      In 2010 David Cameron campaigned on improving transparency and
      accountability. And in 2011 I was working at the Home Office at the time
      when they launched street-level crime maps, showing exactly what crimes
      had been committed across the whole of England and Wales. This example
      typifies what big data can achieve and one that goes to improving
      transparency and accountability.
      In the UK, every Secretary, Minister, political staffer and senior civil
      servant must publish details of meetings with external organisations,
      gifts (given and received), hospitality and overseas travel on a
      quarterly basis. Also an initiative that would go a long way towards
      making the system more accountable and transparent to taxpayers.
      The FoI Act is a powerful tool for the public. But the Government has a
      bill before the Parliament that seeks to undermine and weaken the Act.
      The bill would abolish the Office of the Australian Information
      Commissioner, an independent final place of appeal for those seeking
      documents under the Act. In anticipation of tearing down the office the
      government has stripped it of its funding – a mere $10.2 million over
      four years. The office faces the bizarre situation of still being in
      existence but with no money. Appeals to the office cost nothing but the
      government wants to charge people to appeal to the Administrative Appeals
      Tribunal – this will cost $861, plus legal advice and representation
      charges.
      This issue needs to be resolved before progressing the Open Government
      Partnership action plan. It is incompatible to have a bill before
      Parliament that seeks to undermine the very principles being set out in
      this important task.
      Contrast this with the US where two Senators from either side of politics
      have teamed up to strengthen their FoI Act. The Senate passed the bill by
      unanimous consent. It then was sent to the House of Representatives,
      which had already passed its own version of the reforms by an
      overwhelming vote of 410-0. Given the current political climate in the US
      to achieve such bipartisan agreement on anything is nothing short of a
      miracle. But it does show the importance both sides hold to appearing to
      improve accountability and transparency.
      I welcome this process and congratulate the Government for committing to
      develop a national action plan.

      Hi Pia,
      Just a couple of comments, now that we’re getting to the point of doing
      things globally.
      You’d appreciate that there’s a parallel org to the ogp – the civil
      society end of gov – so we’ll be able to give you some comparative
      feedback on how you go about building the Action plan.au. http://
      www.ogphub.org/napreview-pilot/
      Obviously one of the major products of these plans will developing is a
      “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (built around a citizen’s ID). So we can
      expect (with your imagination) that ad hoc/buckshot approaches like the
      gov 2.0 taskforce will start firming up into a platform which may be used
      by gov, and civil society, groups around the world. http://open4m.org/
      about-us/
      You’re very lucky to have many existing groups of correspondents in
      various countries already that span between the internal groups of a
      government and the civil society groups with which they coordinate
      “actions”. e.g. http://forum.opengovernment.org.uk/groups/ogp
      One more note as you say “NZ and other governments have generally
      established their groups after getting the national action plan
      developed”. That’s not what they are telling others. “New Zealand (as
      one) is in the process of setting up a Stakeholder Advisory Group to
      assist with developing, implementing and evaluating their plans”. http://
      www.ogphub.org/blog/advancing-ogp-in-asia-pacific/
      Personally I prefer the way you’re going about it – keeping things open.
      As Shreya (your OGP contact in Singapore) says in the doc above, “The
      important thing now is to sustain the positive momentum generated by OGP
      and create permanent dialogue mechanisms, with clear terms of reference,
      representation drawn from groups that go beyond the ‘usual suspects’ and
      regular meetings to strengthen the impact of the OGP process on
      government-civil society engagement and to mitigate against risks posed
      by changes in leadership.”
      “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (as the English call it). “Permanent
      Dialogue Mechanism”, “Knowledge Exchange”; call it what you want. That’s
      one deliverable which every gov wants delivered before the “action”
      really starts.

      the flavour of talking to an intelligent being with thoughts and
      responses capable of conveying personal inclinations and values without
      expressing them in anodyne form until they’ve been run up the line for
      approval. The kind of thing that we tried to model in the Government 2.0

      This is welcome news, and appreciate the thought that has gone into
      design of consultative steps so far.
      Two comments.
      One, you state
      “At this stage, it is envisioned that the first Australian Government’s
      NAP will focus on the two OGP grand challenges of:
      • Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of
      citizen services including health, education, criminal justice, water,
      electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by
      fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation; and
      • More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address
      budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign assistance.”
      Many outside government might ponder the ‘envisioning’ without outside
      input that led to this choice of these two challenges from the five laid
      out by the OGP, leaving this challenge off the agenda:
      “. Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and
      public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media
      and civil society freedom.”
      Two, experience elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group
      can enhance the partnership concept and add value. There is no mention of
      such a body in the published material. NZ, well into the process is just
      one of many countries that have now gone down this path.
      http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1508/S00042/advisory-group-for-open-

            Thanks Peter for the feedback and support. Regarding the challenges
            chosen, for the first national action plan it seemed appropriate to
            kick off with a few specific ones but we have taken on your comment
            and will consult on the key themes for future national action
            plans. They are redone every two years.
            Regarding the advisory group, that sounds like a good idea to
            contribute as an action for the government to consider, so please
            add that suggestion to stage 2 of the consultation. NZ and other
            governments have generally established their groups after getting
            the national action plan developed, so in the meantime we will
            reach out and discuss the model with those jurisdictions.

                  Hi Pia
                  I agree, It does make sense to kick off with specific
                  challenges. That being said I also think it makes sense to be
                  prepared to highlight issues of culture, customs and practice
                  where they pose significant risks to dealing with those
                  challenges on there ground.
                  I’d say those components would fall into three categories.
                  Those that can be easily dealt with right away, those that
                  can be spun off as short term project (1-3 months), and those
                  that are of such significance that they would constitute a
                  major new initiative by government. Or could easily be
                  earmarked for inclusion in subsequent actions plans.
                  I think the guiding light within that should be along the
                  lines of speed and agility. Better than a lock step approach
                  IMO.
