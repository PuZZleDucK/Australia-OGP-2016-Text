***** Australian participation in the Open Government Partnership *****
The previous Australian Government indicated its intent to join the OGP in May
2013. In November 2015 the Australian Government launched this consultation as
part of the process to finalise OGP membership.
The Australian Government has committed to the OGP_Declaration_of_Open
Government and independent reporting of Australia progress by the OGP. The
Government will consult publicly to develop an Australian Government OGP
National Action Plan.
The Australian Government can now explore other ways to participate in the
various open government initiatives and working groups associated with the Open
Government Partnership. Any such initiatives Australia gets involved in will be
listed here.
***** Australia’s Open Government Efforts to Date *****
Please note: this content is currently in draft. please add your comments and
feedback in the comments below.
**** Open Reporting, Budgets and Parliamentary Processes ****
Australia has a long history of public sector and parliamentary open reporting.
All government entities are required to produce and publicly publish their
annual reports, budgets, contracts and a variety of other reporting
requirements for the purposes of oversight and transparency. The recent
independent_Review_of_Whole-of-Government_Internal_Regulation gives a good
outline of public sector reporting in the Australian Government. From a
Parliamentary perspective, Australia has also had a good track record, with a
high level of transparency and reporting across all Parliamentary_Business
including federal budgets, bills and legislation, transcripts from all
Parliamentary business, tabled documents, the work of Parliamentary
Committees and much more.
**** Australia’s original Declaration of Open Government ****
In 2009, the Gov 2.0 Taskforce was established to advise the Government on the
structural barriers and enabling policies for greater information disclosure,
digital innovation and online engagement. This included the division of
responsibilities for, and overall coordination of, these issues within
government. A Declaration_of_Open_Government was launched in 2010 (Archived).
In response, the Government made the Declaration_of_Open_Government and
accepted in full the recommendations in the Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for
Reform of Australian Government Administration report, both of which promoted
greater participation in Australia’s democracy, policy and legislative reform,
commitments to open government practices, and greater release of public sector
information.
**** Freedom of Information & Privacy Reforms ****
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was established in
2010 under the new Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. Over the
course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act 1982 was updated
making it easier to request information and seek review of FOI decisions.
Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the Freedom of Information
Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the Australian Information Commissioner
Act 2010 (AIC Act).
The Information Publication Scheme was (IPS) which implemented directing
agencies to take proactive steps to release standard government information in
a consistent way reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of the FOI Act.
In 2014 the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) were added to Schedule 1 of the
Privacy Act 1988. The APPs regulate the handling of personal information by
Australian government and some private sector organisations.
**** Platforms for Data Release ****
Data.gov.au was established in 2010 to enable the centralisation and
distribution of open data and access to government data APIs. The website was
allocated resourcing to initiate whole of government direction and curation of
data. In 2012, data.gov.au was allocated resources to strengthen its role as an
essential element in Australia’s open government strategy. The number of
datasets available on the website has grown from 500 to over 7,000, and is now
working in alignment with state and territory and local governments via the
Cross Jurisdictional Open Data Working Group to improve open data offerings
nationwide.
**** Adoption of Creative Commons ****
In order to accommodate greater access to government information and bring
consistency in licensing arrangements, the public service adapted Creative
Commons Attribution 3.0. The adaption of the license enabled all government
content with the exception of Commonwealth Coat of Arms and unless specifically
stated elsewhere. Details in the AGD_Statement_of_Intellectual_Property
Principles_for_Australian_Government.
**** National Commission of Audit ****
The National_Commission_of_Audit’s (2014) focus on improving the management of
public resources has enabled progressive whole of government changes in a short
time. The government has been proactive in addressing the recommendations
within the 2014/15 budget and in immediate organisational changes to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource management.
As part of the structural reforms following the Audit, we have seen
amalgamations of key government functions including the creation of the Data
Policy Branch within the Department of Communications. This branch is now
positioned to provide overall data policy direction on whole of government
initiatives including the development and implementation of the Australian
Government Open Data policy.
The Audit also recommended further centralisation, sharing, and reuse of
government resources with a focus on gaining from the opportunities innovation
in technology can provide.
**** Changes in culture ****
Open government practices and advances have a dramatic impact on the federal
and state and territory public services. The Australian Public Service is
learning to value the contribution which more transparent, interactive, and
open government practices can offer. It is benefiting from being a workforce
which is looking for improvements based on our public needs – not just to solve
problems when they arise, it is engaging with the public partnerships to
actively encourage private enterprise to provide public services, and it is
leveraging the skills and knowledge of the public to improve how it manages its
services, manages its data, implements new processes. These changes in culture
have been supported by a number of reports in recent years:

      National_Archives_of_Australia on January_8,_2016_at_9:11_am said:
      This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the
      National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives
      Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it
      has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is
      the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in
      government through its legislated role of setting records and information
      management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and
      preserving and providing a public right of access to government
      information. The National Archives supports the consideration of open
      government efforts to date in development of the National Action Plan,
      and inclusion of a section covering this in the Plan itself.
      Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), the National Archives:
      • identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
      • preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth
      accessible;
      • oversees Commonwealth records management;
      • determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
      • imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.
      The Archives Act ensures that evidence of the most important decisions
      and actions of the Australian Government are identified and preserved ,
      and provides a right of access to this information. The National Archives
      submits that its role in providing the foundations for successful open
      government be recognised in the National Action Plan.
      The current background includes a section on Freedom of Information and
      Privacy reforms. The 2010 reforms also resulted in amendments to the
      Archives Act. The primary change was a reduction in the open access
      period (after which members of the public have a right of access to
      Australian government records) from 30 years to 20 years, phased in over
      a 10-year period to 2021. The Archives recommends that this change be
      included in the proposed section on Freedom of Information and Privacy
      reforms.
      In addition, the Archives recommends that a section be included on
      archival access to detail the right of access provided by both
      Commonwealth and state archival legislation to government records. In
      addition to the Commonwealth Archives Act, since the 1920s state archival
      legislation has established a right of access to government records. This
      long history of access to government records afforded by the various
      archival authorities should be recognised in the background on open
      government efforts to date.
      History of the National Archives
      For almost one hundred years, the National Archives has supported the
      principles of open government access through provisions for the
      regulation of the creation, management and destruction of records, and
      promotion of access to Australian government records.
      The need for a Commonwealth archival role was first recognised by Prime
      Minister Hughes in the 1920s, with the increasing volume of records and
      the effect or World War I creating an awareness of the historical value
      of some Commonwealth records. As a result, the Commonwealth National
      Library was tasked with regulating the destruction of records by
      Commonwealth agencies, to ensure that records that could prove valuable
      to future governments and historians were not destroyed. This sews the
      first seeds of open government, by ensuring that significant records were
      retained for future access by Australian citizens.
      The first body with formal responsibility for archives was the War
      Archives Committee which was created in the 1940s. With the initial aim
      of safeguarding the history of both world wars, this role grew with the
      end of World War II to oversight of the disposal of all past and future
      records and coordination of the archival work of the War Memorial and the
      Commonwealth National Library which had been designated as custodians of
      government records. Taking control of destruction was one of the main
      problems of the postwar years as temporary agencies wound up, as well as
      the need to save the money through the efficient disposal of records.
      There was at this stage no formal provision for public access to records.
      In 1966 however the Cabinet agreed to a general policy on access,
      introducing a 50-year rule, with World War I records available earlier.
      In 1970, in alignment with public access provisions in Britain, the
      Australian government adopted the 30-year rule, making records generally
      available for public access after they had been in existence for 30
      years. These provisions for public access to records are the first steps
      in open government.
      There was however still no archival legislation. An early attempt by the
      Parliamentary Library Committee in 1927 to pass an Archives Bill through
      Parliament had failed. In June 1978, a draft Archives Bill was introduced
      in the Senate as part of a package of administrative law measures with
      the Administrative Appeals and Freedom of Information Bills. The Archives
      Act was passed later than the other two Acts (1975 and 1982) in 1983 due
      largely to concerns with provisions for exemption from access. The
      Archives Act complements the right of access afforded by the Freedom of
      Information Act 1982, while also providing for the restriction from
      access of material of continuing sensitivity.
      The functions of the National Archives which are enshrined in the
      Archives Act– disposal of non-current records, custody of records of
      ongoing value and a right of access to these records – underpin the
      principles of open government and should be recognised in any overview of
      open government efforts to date.
      National Archives current initiatives
      The archival resources of the Commonwealth are a unique source of
      evidence and information about the nature of the Commonwealth Government
      and its activities. Identifying, preserving and making accessible the
      archival resources of Commonwealth is not only essential for the conduct
      of Australian government but also:
      • assists the Government and the public to scrutinise the decisions and
      activities of Commonwealth institutions;
      • allows the community to retain and transfer knowledge, learn from past
      experience, and protect the interests of Australians collectively and
      individually; and
      • helps satisfy people’s interest in the decisions and actions of
      Government that affected their and previous generations’ lives or shaped
      the development of Australia.
      The records that document and provide evidence of decisions and actions
      of the Australian Government provide a strong foundation for transparency
      and accountability. Australian Government records also hold information
      that is essential for policy development and the delivery of services.
      The National Archives’ more recent work in implementing the Digital
      Continuity 2020 policy and the Digital Transition Policy provides a
      valuable platform to assist Australian Commonwealth agencies to embed a
      culture of openness and transparency across government. When records are
      digital and managed well, agencies reduce duplication of effort, save
      time, save money and most importantly can share knowledge and information
      within and across agencies, as well as with the Australian community.
      Examples of the current efforts that the Archives will be contributing to
      the National Action Plan as part of its development will include:
      Digital and Online Access
      The National Archives holds over 362.8 shelf kilometres of paper and
      other analogue records and 462.5 terabytes of digital records in secure,
      environmentally controlled repositories around the country. In addition
      to providing access to our collection through our network of reading
      rooms, access is provided online via the Archives website and the
      collection database RecordSearch, as well as a number of specialised
      websites including Discovering Anzacs (defence service), Destination
      Australia (immigration) and Vrroom (for schools).
      The National Archives is also progressively digitising the collection to
      make items more accessible. As at the end of September 2015 over 41
      million pages had been digitised, with more being added each week. In
      2014-15, over 13 million records were accessed via the Archives website.
      We regularly consult with the public to identify items of the greatest
      significance to the Australian community and to make them available
      online.
      Digital Continuity 2020 Policy
      The Digital Continuity 2020 Policy centres on digital information
      governance and complements the Australian Government’s digital
      transformation agenda and the digital economy. The policy aims to support
      efficiency, innovation, interoperability, transparency, information re-
      use and accountability by integrating robust digital information
      management into all government business processes.
      The policy is based on three principles, with targets that agencies
      should reach by 2020, as well as a pathway identifying interim targets.
      All Digital Continuity 2020 targets are expected to be achieved as part
      of normal business reviews and ongoing technology maintenance and
      investment cycles.
      End to end digital project
      An ICT solution that develops capabilities to manage digital government
      information (born digital and digitised) to:
      • provide appropriate online access to all records as soon as possible to
      the public utilising available communication technology, at the time the
      records are required, and in a format and on platforms that meet their
      requirements;
      • incorporate mandated metadata enabling interoperability and sharing of
      information across Australian Government portals, and where appropriate,
      government business systems;
      • ingest, preserve and manage the Commonwealth’s digital records in the
      cloud ensuring their long term integrity, authenticity, and accuracy; and
      • provide cost effective and efficient sentencing of Commonwealth agency
      digital records and their transfer to the Archives.
      Legislative Reform
      The Archives Act provides a public right of access to Commonwealth
      records in the open access period. The Act was amended in 2011 to reduce
      the open access period from 30 years to 20 for Commonwealth records, and
      for Cabinet notebooks from 50 years to 30, with the reduction being
      phased in over a 10-year period.
      The National Archives jointly with the Attorney-General’s Department is
      currently developing a broad package of legislative amendments that will
      amongst other things, seek to address digital transformation related
      matters and improve equitable access to the Archives’ collection for all
      Australians.

      Information Commissioners (NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia)
      on December_11,_2015_at_5:43_pm said:
      The Role of Information Commissioners in Open Government
      The role of Information Commissioners across Australia is to encourage
      public sector agencies to champion open government and to promote the
      release of information to stakeholders and the community. All government
      activity originates in and is sustained by information. Increasing access
      to government information is fundamental to open, democratic government
      engagement with citizens and accountability. State and Territory
      Information Commissioners play a central role in facilitating improved
      information management and release to bolster transparency.
      The following information relates to New South Wales (NSW), Victoria,
      Queensland and South Australia.
      Information access laws across Australian jurisdictions
      Information access and Freedom of Information (FOI) laws across
      Australian jurisdictions are supportive of open government. The objects
      of each legislative regime demonstrate a commitment to open access of
      government-held information, transparency and accountability based on
      democratic principles, including to encourage community participation in
      decision-making. The information access regimes have, over the past few
      years, moved towards supporting and encouraging the proactive disclosure
      of information by public sector agencies to citizens and the community.
      • Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA Act): the
      GIPA Act commenced operation on 24 September 2010. In the second reading
      speech about the GIPA Bill, the then Premier Mr Nathan Rees stated that
      members of the public should be able to have access to the widest
      possible range of information to give them confidence in Government
      decision-making. He also stated that the GIPA Bill shifted the focus
      toward proactive disclosure.
      The GIPA Act is founded on a commitment to maintain and advance a system
      of responsible and representative democratic Government that is open,
      accountable, fair and effective. The object of this Act is to open
      government information to the public by (a) authorising and encouraging
      the proactive public release of government information by agencies, and
      (b) giving members of the public an enforceable right to access
      government information, and (c) providing that access to government
      information is restricted only when there is an overriding public
      interest against disclosure. The GIPA Act promotes the proactive
      disclosure of information through four information release and access
      pathways – mandatory proactive release of information; authorised
      proactive release; informal access; formal access.
      • Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Victoria) (FOI Act): The FOI Act
      commenced on 5 July 1983 and 5 July 1984. The object of this Act is to
      extend as far as possible the right of the community to access
      information in the possession of the Government of Victoria and other
      bodies constituted under the law of Victoria for certain public purposes
      by (a) making available to the public information about the operations of
      agencies and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting
      members of the public in their dealings with agencies are readily
      available to persons affected by those rules and practices; and (b)
      creating a general right of access to information in documentary form in
      the possession of Ministers and agencies limited only by exceptions and
      exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and
      the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom
      information is collected and held by agencies. Part II of the Act
      requires Ministers and agencies to annually publish a range of documents
      including policies and procedures affecting the public, categories of
      documents held, certain reports, as well as information about how members
      of the public may inspect and purchase documents.
      • Right to Information Act 2009 (Queensland) (RTI Act): The RTI Act
      commenced on 1 July 2009. The primary object of the RTI Act is to give a
      right of access to information in the government’s possession or under
      the government’s control unless, on balance, it is contrary to the public
      interest to give the access. Information may be accessed other than by a
      formal application under this Act, for example, the Act requires that
      significant and appropriate information held by agencies be made publicly
      available through publication schemes, preferably online. The RTI Act
      aims to make more information available, provide equal access to
      information across all sectors of the community, and provide appropriate
      protection for individuals’ privacy. Under the RTI Act, information is
      released administratively as a matter of course, unless there is a good
      reason not to, with formal access applications being used as a last
      resort.
      • Freedom of Information Act 1991 (South Australia) (FOI Act): the FOI
      Act commenced operation on 1 January 1992. The FOI Act gives every member
      of the public a right to:
      o access documents which are held by state government departments,
      statutory authorities, councils, public hospitals and universities,
      subject to certain exceptions in the Act; and
      o have records which concern their personal affairs amended, if those
      records are incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.
      In his explanatory speech on the Bill, the then Attorney-General, the Hon
      Chris Sumner MLC, talked of the three major premises on which the Bill
      was based: (1) the individual has a right to know what information is
      contained in Government records about him or herself; (2) a Government
      that is open to public scrutiny is more accountable to the people who
      select it; (3) where people are informed about Government policies, they
      are more likely to become involved in policy making and in Government
      itself. The objects of the Act are to promote openness in government and
      accountability of Ministers of the Crown and other government agencies
      and thereby to enhance respect for the law and further the good
      government of the State; and to facilitate more effective participation
      by members of the public in the processes involved in the making and
      administration of laws and policies.
      NSW, Victoria and Queensland have Information Commissioners who are
      independent statutory office holders.
      • NSW: The Information Commissioner oversights the operation of the GIPA
      Act. The Information Commissioner’s functions include to promote
      agencies’ understanding and practical application of the Act; measure,
      monitor and report on agency compliance; report on the operation of the
      GIPA Act to Parliament; and review decisions of agencies on request under

      Regarding background – in the culture section I think it is worth noting
      that:
      a) Groups of public servants, interested citizens and professionals
      working to advance the practice of Open Gov and Gov2 in Australia have
      formed to constructively support the development of Open Govt across
      Australia. Many of these events have occurred after hours and on weekends
      with attendees doing so out of interest, in their own time.
      b) There have been a significant number of Hackathons, GovCamps (and
      BarCamps) to advance the practice of Open Gov and encourage the use of
      Open Data in Australia.
      c) The Australia Government have hosted and sponsored a number of these
      events to engage citizens and business. In addition to these events they
      (you) have also hosted events to share Open Gov methods and tools with
      others across Government – which have been open to public participation.
      d) Even when these events were not ‘hosted’ or sponsored by Govt, they
      have been fairly well attended by public servants either as interested
      citizens and sometimes endorsed by their managers and on Gov / employer
      time.
      e) In addition to these events, Pia, as an APS staffer, and several
      others in her team have been accessible to, and promoted the initiatives
      of, others advancing Open Gov both inside and from outside of Government
      (at all levels) across Australia (and with other Countries).
      This above has helped maintained the momentum, interest and practice of
      Open Gov in Australia even though we have not formally had another Open
      Gov partnership – nationally or internationally.
      In saying all the above – I, and I can confidently say many of the others
      I have come across though my work in this field, do not underestimate
      what commitment to the OGP means and will be very pleased to see a
      National Action Plan.

      Perhaps understandably the material in the section Australian
      participation in the Open Government Partnership is an abbreviated
      positive version of the interrupted journey towards finalising membership
      of the OGP.
      The omissions in the section on Freedom of Information and Privacy
      Reforms, some of which are mentioned by James McKay however really
      distort the true picture.
      If the bill to abolish the OAIC is withdrawn and the FOI and information
      policy functions of the office adequately funded, fewer corrections would
      be needed.
      We can get by perhaps without a reference in this section or under
      Culture to Public Service Commissioner Lloyd’s opinion that FOI is ‘very
      pernicious.’ To then Australian Information Commissioner McMillan’s view
      that some agencies are ‘gaming the system.’ Or to Treasury Secretary
      Fraser’s observation that public servants these days don’t write
      sensitive stuff down.
      But if the National Commission on Audit is mentioned on the plus side,
      people like me remember the Australian Law Reform Commission Report
      Secrecy and Open Government never received a government response. That
      the Australian Information Commissioner made recommendations in a report
      that quickly disappeared about improvements to the review process. And
      that the privacy changes mentioned in the draft were Phase1 changes
      reflecting issues raised in the mammoth ALRC Privacy Report of 2007.
      Phases Two and Three of the government response never appeared again,
      although generously we could add that mandatory breach notification has
      just been delayed. Two of those lost causes were that the Commonwealth
      lead on national consistency regarding privacy protection, and a
      recommendation that Australia legislate a cause of action for a serious
      breach of privacy.
      The Platforms for Data Release Section is incomplete without reference to
      the findings in the report by your own department last week that weren’t
      uniformly positive.
      The Changes in Culture Section is the equal of the Australian
      participation in the Open Government Partnership Section in telling part
      of the story.
      Overall without listing all the warts the Background Section should be
      honest and realistic about where things stand. At the moment it reads
      like one of those rarely read annual reports that are brimming with good
      news and admit no failures or concerns.

      Perhaps it is worth explaining why many core datasets have been unable to
      be released. Some of these are cultural but others are structural.
      Government organisations such as the PSMA, Australia Post and the Bureau
      of Meteorology hold many core reference datasets that have not been
      released as open data e.g. Weather forecasts, postcodes, addresses, and
      more.
      The business models and funding arrangements for these organisations work
      against them publishing open data as the PSMA explain here https://
      www.psma.com.au/publications/news/delivering-benefits-through-open-data
      The closed nature of these datasets holds back Australia’s standing
      globally (e.g. http://index.okfn.org) but more importantly, inhibits the
      generation of value in a number of areas. The release of weather data is
      important to support both agriculture and disaster management. Addresses
      and Postcodes would be used by nearly every business in Australia. I
      can’t believe we can’t even publish State Boundaries as open data (http:/
      /data.gov.au/dataset/other-state-boundary-psma-administrative-boundaries)
      with the licence for personal use expiring on 30 Dec 2015.
      Perhaps there have been efforts to release this data – if so, they should
      be acknowledged. If not, then we have a nice segway into some future
      actions.

      It is wonderful to see Australia embracing this process at last after
      sitting on its hands and going in the opposite direction for so long.
      We note and endorse all of Steve Davies comments in his post on November
      23rd at 10:47 am.
      Australia is suffering from 20th century policies that have resulted in a
      “hollowing out” of communities and also of civil society. This has meant
      a reduction in community participation and control of services and
      decision-making within communities. This has resulted in a loss of
      knowledge, skills, involvement, interest, and even more importantly, in
      the confidence needed to participate effectively. Our communities have
      disengaged from key issues affecting them, their communities and the
      country.
      This is no more apparent and more counterproductive than in services to
      the community provided by or funded by government. Many, like the jobs
      market and vocational training, have failed. Major community stakeholders
      and the community itself have been excluded from participation in
      planning as well as from implementation largely because they would have
      held contrary views and challenged implementation. This is well
      illustrated in aged care where even the Productivity Commission has
      commented on the adverse impact poor public awareness has had on the
      implementation of changes – changes where many would have advocated
      community involvement, better alternatives and better implementation.
      Open government cannot be effective and recognise its potential unless
      there is a knowledgeable, skilled and interested civic community of
      citizens willing to engage and participate. We have allowed our civic
      society to decay. Open government is primarily about engaging with civil
      society, which is where Australia is most deficient. It has instead
      focused on stakeholders who represent particular commercial, employee and
      other marketplace interests, so distorting the input that it gets.
      The most important grand challenge for Australia, if it is going to
      assume a leadership role in this endeavour and recover the ground it has
      lost, is to re-engage the community in the affairs of the community at
      all levels. I am writing to urge Australia to put “Participation” as its
      first “grand challenge” ahead of the two planned. “Improving Public
      Services” should be second as it is largely responsible for what has
      happened. Together they will set the scene for further developments.
      There is growing evidence showing the importance of community involvement
      in services to their communities – both to the success of the services
      and to building social capital and so rejuvenating civil society.
      The team behind Aged Care Crisis Inc. is addressing these problems and
      trying to bring aged care into the 21st century by opening discussion
      within the community and by making submissions to government inquiries.
      We are urging changes that would see community groups involved in the
      provision, in the management, in the control of, and in decision making
      at all levels of the aged care process. We want to see the development of
      a community with the knowledge and skills needed in the community, skills
      that are also required for effective open government. We urge government
      and those communities receiving other government services to adopt a
      similar approach.

      Observations around the text of FOI Reforms – the following statement is
      true:
      “Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act
      1982 was updated making it easier to request information and seek review
      of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the
      Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the
      Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act).”
      What is not mentioned is the current Government policy contained within
      the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill 2014 to
      actually roll back some of those reforms.
      In fact, since then, things have become harder, due to the miserly
      funding cuts doled out to the OAIC, frustrating their statutory
      obligations to promote the purposes of the FOI Act across the APS
      (although I must commend the OAIC for carrying on so determinedly with
      such few resources).
      Nor is there the acknowledgement that in 2013, a review in to FOI law and
      administration was carried out by Dr Hawke, with the number one
      recommendation being “that a comprehensive review of the FOI Act be
      undertaken”.
      There was no recommendation in that review to abolish the OAIC, which is
      part of the current bill before Parliament.
      If the “Background” to the actual status of Open Government in Parliament
      is muddied and presents a selective recent history, then the very
      principles of transparency are being undermined at the first turn.

      Time and again the issue of the culture of the Australian Public Service
      has been identified as being highly problematic for open government and,
      indeed, innovation.
      Through my work and many conversations what stands out is that there is
      considerable cultural resistance to engaging in open dialogue about the
      more extreme manifestations of the cultural short comings of the
      Australian Public Service.
      Four aspects of the culture stand out. They are as follows:
      1. Practices that generate large amounts of self-censorship.
      2. There is a lot of fear about having difficult and confronting
      conversations. So one of key challenges is to strip away that fear. To
      ensure, from the very first step, that all people – not just those who
      are ‘into open government’ – know (at its most elemental level), that
      it’s OK to speak out.
      3. The distorting impact of the obsession with the reputation of the
      public service being so severe that it generates destructive and self
      serving defensive routines. At its worse this results in systemic abuses
      of power (and there are many).
      4. The very low tolerance of challenging and dissenting views and
      information.
      I could go on and on, but suffice it so say these cultural artefacts (and
      more) are anathema to open government. Consequently, it is imperative (if
      there is to be any depth to open government), that these issues be
      publicly discussed.
      Doing so is essential to demonstrating to the public that the Australian
      Government is authentic about open government and encouraging engagement.
      If we fall into the trap (again), of not having these difficult
      conversations about the health of government and public service then we
      will be providing and weak platform for open government and Australian
      democracy in the 21st century. Let alone decency in government.
      By showing courage and being forthright about these issues I believe
      Australia could set a world leading example in relation to the Open
      Government Partnership.
      Cheers – Steve
