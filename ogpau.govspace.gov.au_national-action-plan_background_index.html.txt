-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previous Australian Government indicated its intent to join the OGP
in May 2013. In November 2015 the Australian Government launched this
consultation as part of the process to finalise OGP membership.

The Australian Government has committed to the [OGP Declaration of Open
Government](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration)
and independent reporting of Australia progress by the OGP. The
Government will consult publicly to develop an Australian Government OGP
National Action Plan.

The Australian Government can now explore other ways to participate in
the various open government initiatives and working groups associated
with the Open Government Partnership. Any such initiatives Australia
gets involved in will be listed here.

### <span id="Open_Reporting_Budgets_and_Parliamentary_Processes">Open Reporting, Budgets and Parliamentary Processes</span>

Australia has a long history of public sector and parliamentary open
reporting. All government entities are required to produce and publicly
publish their annual reports, budgets, contracts and a variety of other
reporting requirements for the purposes of oversight and transparency.
The [recent independent Review of Whole-of-Government Internal
Regulation](http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/reducingredtape/)
gives a good outline of public sector reporting in the Australian
Government. From a Parliamentary perspective, Australia has also had a
good track record, with a high level of transparency and reporting
across all [Parliamentary
Business](http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business) including
federal budgets, bills and legislation, transcripts from all
Parliamentary business, tabled documents, the work of Parliamentary
Committees and much more.

### <span id="Australias_original_Declaration_of_Open_Government">Australia’s original Declaration of Open Government</span>

In 2009, the Gov 2.0 Taskforce was established to advise the Government
on the structural barriers and enabling policies for greater information
disclosure, digital innovation and online engagement. This included the
division of responsibilities for, and overall coordination of, these
issues within government. A [Declaration of Open
Government](http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2010/07/16/declaration-open-government/) was
launched in 2010 (Archived).

In response, the Government made the [Declaration of Open
Government](http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/strategy-and-governance/gov2/declaration-of-open-government.html){.broken_link}
and accepted in full the recommendations in the Ahead of the Game:
Blueprint for Reform of Australian Government Administration report,
both of which promoted greater participation in Australia’s democracy,
policy and legislative reform, commitments to open government practices,
and greater release of public sector information.

### <span id="Freedom_of_Information_Privacy_Reforms">Freedom of Information & Privacy Reforms</span>

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was
established in 2010 under the new Australian Information Commissioner
Act 2010. Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of
Information Act 1982 was updated making it easier to request information
and seek review of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the
passage of the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth)
and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act).

The Information Publication Scheme was (IPS) which implemented directing
agencies to take proactive steps to release standard government
information in a consistent way reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of
the FOI Act.

In 2014 the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) were added to Schedule 1
of the Privacy Act 1988. The APPs regulate the handling of personal
information by Australian government and some private sector
organisations.

### <span id="Platforms_for_Data_Release">Platforms for Data Release</span>

[Data.gov.au](http://data.gov.au/) was established in 2010 to enable the
centralisation and distribution of open data and access to government
data APIs. The website was allocated resourcing to initiate whole of
government direction and curation of data. In 2012, data.gov.au was
allocated resources to strengthen its role as an essential element in
Australia’s open government strategy. The number of datasets available
on the website has grown from 500 to over 7,000, and is now working in
alignment with state and territory and local governments via the Cross
Jurisdictional Open Data Working Group to improve open data offerings
nationwide.

### <span id="Adoption_of_Creative_Commons">Adoption of Creative Commons</span>

In order to accommodate greater access to government information and
bring consistency in licensing arrangements, the public service adapted
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0. The adaption of the license enabled
all government content with the exception of Commonwealth Coat of Arms
and unless specifically stated elsewhere. Details in the [AGD Statement
of Intellectual Property Principles for Australian
Government](../../../www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IntellectualProperty/Documents/StatementofIPprinciplesforAusGovagencies.html){.broken_link}.

### <span id="National_Commission_of_Audit">National Commission of Audit</span>

The [National Commission of Audit’s](http://www.ncoa.gov.au/) (2014)
focus on improving the management of public resources has enabled
progressive whole of government changes in a short time. The government
has been proactive in addressing the recommendations within the 2014/15
budget and in immediate organisational changes to improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of public resource management.

As part of the structural reforms following the Audit, we have seen
amalgamations of key government functions including the creation of the
Data Policy Branch within the Department of Communications. This branch
is now positioned to provide overall data policy direction on whole of
government initiatives including the development and implementation of
the Australian Government Open Data policy.

The Audit also recommended further centralisation, sharing, and reuse of
government resources with a focus on gaining from the opportunities
innovation in technology can provide.

### <span id="Changes_in_culture">Changes in culture</span>

Open government practices and advances have a dramatic impact on the
federal and state and territory public services. The Australian Public
Service is learning to value the contribution which more transparent,
interactive, and open government practices can offer. It is benefiting
from being a workforce which is looking for improvements based on our
public needs – not just to solve problems when they arise, it is
engaging with the public partnerships to actively encourage private
enterprise to provide public services, and it is leveraging the skills
and knowledge of the public to improve how it manages its services,
manages its data, implements new processes. These changes in culture
have been supported by a number of reports in recent years:

    <div class="comment-content">

    This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the
    National Archives). The National Archives was established by the
    Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian
    Government, although it has existed in various forms since
    the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring
    transparency and accountability in government through its legislated
    role of setting records and information management requirements for
    Australian Government agencies, and preserving and providing a
    public right of access to government information. The National
    Archives supports the consideration of open government efforts to
    date in development of the National Action Plan, and inclusion of a
    section covering this in the Plan itself.

    Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), the National Archives:\
    • identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;\
    • preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth
    accessible;\
    • oversees Commonwealth records management;\
    • determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies;
    and\
    • imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of
    Commonwealth records.

    The Archives Act ensures that evidence of the most important
    decisions and actions of the Australian Government are identified
    and preserved , and provides a right of access to this information.
    The National Archives submits that its role in providing the
    foundations for successful open government be recognised in the
    National Action Plan.

    The current background includes a section on Freedom of Information
    and Privacy reforms. The 2010 reforms also resulted in amendments to
    the Archives Act. The primary change was a reduction in the open
    access period (after which members of the public have a right of
    access to Australian government records) from 30 years to 20 years,
    phased in over a 10-year period to 2021. The Archives recommends
    that this change be included in the proposed section on Freedom of
    Information and Privacy reforms.

    In addition, the Archives recommends that a section be included on
    archival access to detail the right of access provided by both
    Commonwealth and state archival legislation to government records.
    In addition to the Commonwealth Archives Act, since the 1920s state
    archival legislation has established a right of access to
    government records. This long history of access to government
    records afforded by the various archival authorities should be
    recognised in the background on open government efforts to date.

    History of the National Archives\
    For almost one hundred years, the National Archives has supported
    the principles of open government access through provisions for the
    regulation of the creation, management and destruction of records,
    and promotion of access to Australian government records.

    The need for a Commonwealth archival role was first recognised by
    Prime Minister Hughes in the 1920s, with the increasing volume of
    records and the effect or World War I creating an awareness of the
    historical value of some Commonwealth records. As a result, the
    Commonwealth National Library was tasked with regulating the
    destruction of records by Commonwealth agencies, to ensure that
    records that could prove valuable to future governments and
    historians were not destroyed. This sews the first seeds of open
    government, by ensuring that significant records were retained for
    future access by Australian citizens.

    The first body with formal responsibility for archives was the War
    Archives Committee which was created in the 1940s. With the initial
    aim of safeguarding the history of both world wars, this role grew
    with the end of World War II to oversight of the disposal of all
    past and future records and coordination of the archival work of the
    War Memorial and the Commonwealth National Library which had been
    designated as custodians of government records. Taking control of
    destruction was one of the main problems of the postwar years as
    temporary agencies wound up, as well as the need to save the money
    through the efficient disposal of records.

    There was at this stage no formal provision for public access
    to records. In 1966 however the Cabinet agreed to a general policy
    on access, introducing a 50-year rule, with World War I records
    available earlier. In 1970, in alignment with public access
    provisions in Britain, the Australian government adopted the 30-year
    rule, making records generally available for public access after
    they had been in existence for 30 years. These provisions for public
    access to records are the first steps in open government.

    There was however still no archival legislation. An early attempt by
    the Parliamentary Library Committee in 1927 to pass an Archives Bill
    through Parliament had failed. In June 1978, a draft Archives Bill
    was introduced in the Senate as part of a package of administrative
    law measures with the Administrative Appeals and Freedom of
    Information Bills. The Archives Act was passed later than the other
    two Acts (1975 and 1982) in 1983 due largely to concerns with
    provisions for exemption from access. The Archives Act complements
    the right of access afforded by the Freedom of Information Act 1982,
    while also providing for the restriction from access of material of
    continuing sensitivity.

    The functions of the National Archives which are enshrined in the
    Archives Act– disposal of non-current records, custody of records of
    ongoing value and a right of access to these records – underpin the
    principles of open government and should be recognised in any
    overview of open government efforts to date.

    National Archives current initiatives\
    The archival resources of the Commonwealth are a unique source of
    evidence and information about the nature of the Commonwealth
    Government and its activities. Identifying, preserving and making
    accessible the archival resources of Commonwealth is not only
    essential for the conduct of Australian government but also:\
    • assists the Government and the public to scrutinise the decisions
    and activities of Commonwealth institutions;\
    • allows the community to retain and transfer knowledge, learn from
    past experience, and protect the interests of Australians
    collectively and individually; and\
    • helps satisfy people’s interest in the decisions and actions of
    Government that affected their and previous generations’ lives or
    shaped the development of Australia.

    The records that document and provide evidence of decisions and
    actions of the Australian Government provide a strong foundation for
    transparency and accountability. Australian Government records also
    hold information that is essential for policy development and the
    delivery of services.

    The National Archives’ more recent work in implementing the Digital
    Continuity 2020 policy and the Digital Transition Policy provides a
    valuable platform to assist Australian Commonwealth agencies to
    embed a culture of openness and transparency across government. When
    records are digital and managed well, agencies reduce duplication of
    effort, save time, save money and most importantly can share
    knowledge and information within and across agencies, as well as
    with the Australian community.

    Examples of the current efforts that the Archives will be
    contributing to the National Action Plan as part of its development
    will include:

    Digital and Online Access\
    The National Archives holds over 362.8 shelf kilometres of paper and
    other analogue records and 462.5 terabytes of digital records in
    secure, environmentally controlled repositories around the country.
    In addition to providing access to our collection through our
    network of reading rooms, access is provided online via the Archives
    website and the collection database RecordSearch, as well as a
    number of specialised websites including Discovering Anzacs (defence
    service), Destination Australia (immigration) and Vrroom
    (for schools).

    The National Archives is also progressively digitising the
    collection to make items more accessible. As at the end of September
    2015 over 41 million pages had been digitised, with more being added
    each week. In 2014-15, over 13 million records were accessed via the
    Archives website. We regularly consult with the public to identify
    items of the greatest significance to the Australian community and
    to make them available online.

    Digital Continuity 2020 Policy\
    The Digital Continuity 2020 Policy centres on digital information
    governance and complements the Australian Government’s digital
    transformation agenda and the digital economy. The policy aims to
    support efficiency, innovation, interoperability, transparency,
    information re-use and accountability by integrating robust digital
    information management into all government business processes.

    The policy is based on three principles, with targets that agencies
    should reach by 2020, as well as a pathway identifying
    interim targets. All Digital Continuity 2020 targets are expected to
    be achieved as part of normal business reviews and ongoing
    technology maintenance and investment cycles.

    End to end digital project\
    An ICT solution that develops capabilities to manage digital
    government information (born digital and digitised) to:\
    • provide appropriate online access to all records as soon as
    possible to the public utilising available communication technology,
    at the time the records are required, and in a format and on
    platforms that meet their requirements;\
    • incorporate mandated metadata enabling interoperability and
    sharing of information across Australian Government portals, and
    where appropriate, government business systems;\
    • ingest, preserve and manage the Commonwealth’s digital records in
    the cloud ensuring their long term integrity, authenticity, and
    accuracy; and\
    • provide cost effective and efficient sentencing of Commonwealth
    agency digital records and their transfer to the Archives.

    Legislative Reform\
    The Archives Act provides a public right of access to Commonwealth
    records in the open access period. The Act was amended in 2011 to
    reduce the open access period from 30 years to 20 for Commonwealth
    records, and for Cabinet notebooks from 50 years to 30, with the
    reduction being phased in over a 10-year period.

    The National Archives jointly with the Attorney-General’s Department
    is currently developing a broad package of legislative amendments
    that will amongst other things, seek to address digital
    transformation related matters and improve equitable access to the
    Archives’ collection for all Australians.

    The Role of Information Commissioners in Open Government\
    The role of Information Commissioners across Australia is to
    encourage public sector agencies to champion open government and to
    promote the release of information to stakeholders and
    the community. All government activity originates in and is
    sustained by information. Increasing access to government
    information is fundamental to open, democratic government engagement
    with citizens and accountability. State and Territory Information
    Commissioners play a central role in facilitating improved
    information management and release to bolster transparency.

    The following information relates to New South Wales (NSW),
    Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.

    Information access laws across Australian jurisdictions\
    Information access and Freedom of Information (FOI) laws across
    Australian jurisdictions are supportive of open government. The
    objects of each legislative regime demonstrate a commitment to open
    access of government-held information, transparency and
    accountability based on democratic principles, including to
    encourage community participation in decision-making. The
    information access regimes have, over the past few years, moved
    towards supporting and encouraging the proactive disclosure of
    information by public sector agencies to citizens and the community.

    • Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA Act):
    the GIPA Act commenced operation on 24 September 2010. In the second
    reading speech about the GIPA Bill, the then Premier Mr Nathan Rees
    stated that members of the public should be able to have access to
    the widest possible range of information to give them confidence in
    Government decision-making. He also stated that the GIPA Bill
    shifted the focus toward proactive disclosure.\
    The GIPA Act is founded on a commitment to maintain and advance a
    system of responsible and representative democratic Government that
    is open, accountable, fair and effective. The object of this Act is
    to open government information to the public by (a) authorising and
    encouraging the proactive public release of government information
    by agencies, and (b) giving members of the public an enforceable
    right to access government information, and (c) providing that
    access to government information is restricted only when there is an
    overriding public interest against disclosure. The GIPA Act promotes
    the proactive disclosure of information through four information
    release and access pathways – mandatory proactive release of
    information; authorised proactive release; informal access;
    formal access.

    • Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Victoria) (FOI Act): The FOI Act
    commenced on 5 July 1983 and 5 July 1984. The object of this Act is
    to extend as far as possible the right of the community to access
    information in the possession of the Government of Victoria and
    other bodies constituted under the law of Victoria for certain
    public purposes by (a) making available to the public information
    about the operations of agencies and, in particular, ensuring that
    rules and practices affecting members of the public in their
    dealings with agencies are readily available to persons affected by
    those rules and practices; and (b) creating a general right of
    access to information in documentary form in the possession of
    Ministers and agencies limited only by exceptions and exemptions
    necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the
    private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom
    information is collected and held by agencies. Part II of the Act
    requires Ministers and agencies to annually publish a range of
    documents including policies and procedures affecting the public,
    categories of documents held, certain reports, as well as
    information about how members of the public may inspect and
    purchase documents.

    • Right to Information Act 2009 (Queensland) (RTI Act): The RTI Act
    commenced on 1 July 2009. The primary object of the RTI Act is to
    give a right of access to information in the government’s possession
    or under the government’s control unless, on balance, it is contrary
    to the public interest to give the access. Information may be
    accessed other than by a formal application under this Act, for
    example, the Act requires that significant and appropriate
    information held by agencies be made publicly available through
    publication schemes, preferably online. The RTI Act aims to make
    more information available, provide equal access to information
    across all sectors of the community, and provide appropriate
    protection for individuals’ privacy. Under the RTI Act, information
    is released administratively as a matter of course, unless there is
    a good reason not to, with formal access applications being used as
    a last resort.

    • Freedom of Information Act 1991 (South Australia) (FOI Act): the
    FOI Act commenced operation on 1 January 1992. The FOI Act gives
    every member of the public a right to:\
    o access documents which are held by state government departments,
    statutory authorities, councils, public hospitals and universities,
    subject to certain exceptions in the Act; and\
    o have records which concern their personal affairs amended, if
    those records are incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.\
    In his explanatory speech on the Bill, the then Attorney-General,
    the Hon Chris Sumner MLC, talked of the three major premises on
    which the Bill was based: (1) the individual has a right to know
    what information is contained in Government records about him or
    herself; (2) a Government that is open to public scrutiny is more
    accountable to the people who select it; (3) where people are
    informed about Government policies, they are more likely to become
    involved in policy making and in Government itself. The objects of
    the Act are to promote openness in government and accountability of
    Ministers of the Crown and other government agencies and thereby to
    enhance respect for the law and further the good government of the
    State; and to facilitate more effective participation by members of
    the public in the processes involved in the making and
    administration of laws and policies.

    NSW, Victoria and Queensland have Information Commissioners who are
    independent statutory office holders.

    • NSW: The Information Commissioner oversights the operation of the
    GIPA Act. The Information Commissioner’s functions include to
    promote agencies’ understanding and practical application of the
    Act; measure, monitor and report on agency compliance; report on the
    operation of the GIPA Act to Parliament; and review decisions of
    agencies on request under the GIPA Act.

    • Victoria: the FOI Commissioner’s functions and powers include to
    promote understanding and acceptance by agencies of the Act and its
    object; to conduct reviews of decisions by agencies on requests
    under the Act; to receive and handle complaints; to monitor
    compliance by agencies with those professional standards; to provide
    advice, education and guidance to agencies in relation to compliance
    with any professional standards; to provide advice, education and
    guidance to agencies and the public; to report on the operation of
    the Act; to provide advice to the Minister on the operation and
    administration of the Act. In carrying out these functions the
    office the FOI Commissioner aims to ensure there is a fair and
    transparent flow of government held information, and to educate
    Victorians and the agencies that work on their behalf to understand
    their rights and responsibilities to one another.

    • Queensland: the Office of the Information Commissioner’s role
    includes independently review decisions made by Queensland Ministers
    and public sector agencies about access to or amendment of,
    documents; to mediate privacy complaints; promote information rights
    and responsibilities; and foster improvements in the quality of
    right to information privacy practices.\
    The Information Commissioner is supported by two other statutory
    office holders appointed by the Governor-in-Council – the Right to
    Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner.

    South Australia does not have Information Commissioners and instead,
    relies on the Ombudsman to provide a complaint or review function,
    and to champion open and transparent government. State Records
    assists the Minister responsible for administrating the FOI Act. The
    Ombudsman is the review authority under the FOI Act for external
    reviews of agencies’ decisions under the FOI Act (including in
    relation to access, amendment of personal records, and fees
    and charges).

    DISCLAIMER: This response has been provided by Information
    Commissioners and does not reflect the views of the respective State
    and Territory governments.

    Regarding background – in the culture section I think it is worth
    noting that:\
    a) Groups of public servants, interested citizens and professionals
    working to advance the practice of Open Gov and Gov2 in Australia
    have formed to constructively support the development of Open Govt
    across Australia. Many of these events have occurred after hours and
    on weekends with attendees doing so out of interest, in their own
    time.\
    b) There have been a significant number of Hackathons, GovCamps
    (and BarCamps) to advance the practice of Open Gov and encourage the
    use of Open Data in Australia.\
    c) The Australia Government have hosted and sponsored a number of
    these events to engage citizens and business. In addition to these
    events they (you) have also hosted events to share Open Gov methods
    and tools with others across Government – which have been open to
    public participation.\
    d) Even when these events were not ‘hosted’ or sponsored by Govt,
    they have been fairly well attended by public servants either as
    interested citizens and sometimes endorsed by their managers and on
    Gov / employer time.\
    e) In addition to these events, Pia, as an APS staffer, and several
    others in her team have been accessible to, and promoted the
    initiatives of, others advancing Open Gov both inside and from
    outside of Government (at all levels) across Australia (and with
    other Countries).\
    This above has helped maintained the momentum, interest and practice
    of Open Gov in Australia even though we have not formally had
    another Open Gov partnership – nationally or internationally.\
    In saying all the above – I, and I can confidently say many of the
    others I have come across though my work in this field, do not
    underestimate what commitment to the OGP means and will be very
    pleased to see a National Action Plan.

    Perhaps understandably the material in the section Australian
    participation in the Open Government Partnership is an abbreviated
    positive version of the interrupted journey towards finalising
    membership of the OGP.

    The omissions in the section on Freedom of Information and Privacy
    Reforms, some of which are mentioned by James McKay however really
    distort the true picture.

    If the bill to abolish the OAIC is withdrawn and the FOI and
    information policy functions of the office adequately funded, fewer
    corrections would be needed.

    We can get by perhaps without a reference in this section or under
    Culture to Public Service Commissioner Lloyd’s opinion that FOI is
    ‘very pernicious.’ To then Australian Information Commissioner
    McMillan’s view that some agencies are ‘gaming the system.’ Or to
    Treasury Secretary Fraser’s observation that public servants these
    days don’t write sensitive stuff down.

    But if the National Commission on Audit is mentioned on the plus
    side, people like me remember the Australian Law Reform Commission
    Report Secrecy and Open Government never received a
    government response. That the Australian Information Commissioner
    made recommendations in a report that quickly disappeared about
    improvements to the review process. And that the privacy changes
    mentioned in the draft were Phase1 changes reflecting issues raised
    in the mammoth ALRC Privacy Report of 2007. Phases Two and Three of
    the government response never appeared again, although generously we
    could add that mandatory breach notification has just been delayed.
    Two of those lost causes were that the Commonwealth lead on national
    consistency regarding privacy protection, and a recommendation that
    Australia legislate a cause of action for a serious breach
    of privacy.

    The Platforms for Data Release Section is incomplete without
    reference to the findings in the report by your own department last
    week that weren’t uniformly positive.

    The Changes in Culture Section is the equal of the Australian
    participation in the Open Government Partnership Section in telling
    part of the story.

    Overall without listing all the warts the Background Section should
    be honest and realistic about where things stand. At the moment it
    reads like one of those rarely read annual reports that are brimming
    with good news and admit no failures or concerns.

    Perhaps it is worth explaining why many core datasets have been
    unable to be released. Some of these are cultural but others
    are structural.

    Government organisations such as the PSMA, Australia Post and the
    Bureau of Meteorology hold many core reference datasets that have
    not been released as open data e.g. Weather forecasts, postcodes,
    addresses, and more.

    The business models and funding arrangements for these organisations
    work against them publishing open data as the PSMA explain here
    <https://www.psma.com.au/publications/news/delivering-benefits-through-open-data>

    The closed nature of these datasets holds back Australia’s standing
    globally (e.g. [http://index.okfn.org](http://index.okfn.org/)) but
    more importantly, inhibits the generation of value in a number
    of areas. The release of weather data is important to support both
    agriculture and disaster management. Addresses and Postcodes would
    be used by nearly every business in Australia. I can’t believe we
    can’t even publish State Boundaries as open data
    (<http://data.gov.au/dataset/other-state-boundary-psma-administrative-boundaries>)
    with the licence for personal use expiring on 30 Dec 2015.

    Perhaps there have been efforts to release this data – if so, they
    should be acknowledged. If not, then we have a nice segway into some
    future actions.

    It is wonderful to see Australia embracing this process at last
    after sitting on its hands and going in the opposite direction for
    so long.

    We note and endorse all of Steve Davies comments in his post on
    November 23rd at 10:47 am.

    Australia is suffering from 20th century policies that have resulted
    in a “hollowing out” of communities and also of civil society. This
    has meant a reduction in community participation and control of
    services and decision-making within communities. This has resulted
    in a loss of knowledge, skills, involvement, interest, and even more
    importantly, in the confidence needed to participate effectively.
    Our communities have disengaged from key issues affecting them,
    their communities and the country.

    This is no more apparent and more counterproductive than in services
    to the community provided by or funded by government. Many, like the
    jobs market and vocational training, have failed. Major community
    stakeholders and the community itself have been excluded from
    participation in planning as well as from implementation largely
    because they would have held contrary views and
    challenged implementation. This is well illustrated in aged care
    where even the Productivity Commission has commented on the adverse
    impact poor public awareness has had on the implementation of
    changes – changes where many would have advocated community
    involvement, better alternatives and better implementation.

    Open government cannot be effective and recognise its potential
    unless there is a knowledgeable, skilled and interested civic
    community of citizens willing to engage and participate. We have
    allowed our civic society to decay. Open government is primarily
    about engaging with civil society, which is where Australia is
    most deficient. It has instead focused on stakeholders who represent
    particular commercial, employee and other marketplace interests, so
    distorting the input that it gets.

    The most important grand challenge for Australia, if it is going to
    assume a leadership role in this endeavour and recover the ground it
    has lost, is to re-engage the community in the affairs of the
    community at all levels. I am writing to urge Australia to put
    “Participation” as its first “grand challenge” ahead of the
    two planned. “Improving Public Services” should be second as it is
    largely responsible for what has happened. Together they will set
    the scene for further developments. There is growing evidence
    showing the importance of community involvement in services to their
    communities – both to the success of the services and to building
    social capital and so rejuvenating civil society.

    The team behind Aged Care Crisis Inc. is addressing these problems
    and trying to bring aged care into the 21st century by opening
    discussion within the community and by making submissions to
    government inquiries. We are urging changes that would see community
    groups involved in the provision, in the management, in the control
    of, and in decision making at all levels of the aged care process.
    We want to see the development of a community with the knowledge and
    skills needed in the community, skills that are also required for
    effective open government. We urge government and those communities
    receiving other government services to adopt a similar approach.

    Observations around the text of FOI Reforms – the following
    statement is true:

    “Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of Information
    Act 1982 was updated making it easier to request information and
    seek review of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the
    passage of the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act
    2010 (Cth) and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC
    Act).”

    What is not mentioned is the current Government policy contained
    within the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill
    2014 to actually roll back some of those reforms.

    In fact, since then, things have become harder, due to the miserly
    funding cuts doled out to the OAIC, frustrating their statutory
    obligations to promote the purposes of the FOI Act across the APS
    (although I must commend the OAIC for carrying on so determinedly
    with such few resources).

    Nor is there the acknowledgement that in 2013, a review in to FOI
    law and administration was carried out by Dr Hawke, with the number
    one recommendation being “that a comprehensive review of the FOI Act
    be undertaken”.

    There was no recommendation in that review to abolish the OAIC,
    which is part of the current bill before Parliament.

    If the “Background” to the actual status of Open Government in
    Parliament is muddied and presents a selective recent history, then
    the very principles of transparency are being undermined at the
    first turn.

    Time and again the issue of the culture of the Australian Public
    Service has been identified as being highly problematic for open
    government and, indeed, innovation.

    Through my work and many conversations what stands out is that there
    is considerable cultural resistance to engaging in open dialogue
    about the more extreme manifestations of the cultural short comings
    of the Australian Public Service.

    Four aspects of the culture stand out. They are as follows:

    1\. Practices that generate large amounts of self-censorship.

    2\. There is a lot of fear about having difficult and
    confronting conversations. So one of key challenges is to strip away
    that fear. To ensure, from the very first step, that all people – not
    just those who are ‘into open government’ – know (at its most elemental
    level), that it’s OK to speak out.

    3\. The distorting impact of the obsession with the reputation of the
    public service being so severe that it generates destructive and self
    serving defensive routines. At its worse this results in systemic abuses
    of power (and there are many).

    4\. The very low tolerance of challenging and dissenting views
    and information.

    I could go on and on, but suffice it so say these cultural artefacts
    (and more) are anathema to open government. Consequently, it is
    imperative (if there is to be any depth to open government), that
    these issues be publicly discussed.

    Doing so is essential to demonstrating to the public that the
    Australian Government is authentic about open government and
    encouraging engagement.

    If we fall into the trap (again), of not having these difficult
    conversations about the health of government and public service then
    we will be providing and weak platform for open government and
    Australian democracy in the 21st century. Let alone decency
    in government.

    By showing courage and being forthright about these issues I believe
    Australia could set a world leading example in relation to the Open
    Government Partnership.

    Cheers – Steve
