****** OGP Update – 3 August ******
Posted on August_3,_2016  by  ogpteam
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.
