				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) will be seeking to further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership (OGP) by the end of October 2016.</p>
<p>Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of 2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in a spirit of genuine partnership.</p>
<p>We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate.  It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.</p>
<p>Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.</p>

			<p>Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia&#8217;s first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions, prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) have are pleased with the event, participation and the outputs generated.</p>
<p><strong>Participants in the co-creation workshop </strong><br />
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>36 from Civil Society &#8211; NGO&#8217;s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov actions</li>
<li>4 from PM&amp;C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and Transformation</li>
<li>15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry, Innovation and Science</li>
<li>1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor&#8217;s Office</li>
<li>The Information Commissioner from NSW</li>
<li>2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit</li>
<li>2 from State Governments</li>
<li>2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates </strong><br />
Participants at the workshop discussed the <a href="../submissions/index.html" target="_blank">210 actions suggested by civil society</a> and those suggested by agencies through the <a href="../../second-idc/index.html" target="_blank">InterDepartmental Committee (IDC). </a>Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of the workshop and details of attendees are available on <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=ace219a644fa786aeac66dd71aafacc1" target="_blank">this page of the wiki. </a></p>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong><br />
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the workshop have now been taken by PM&amp;C to executives in agencies nominated to lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is submitted to the OGP in July.</p>
<p>See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667" target="_blank">on this wiki. </a></p>
<p><strong>Ongoing engagement for OGPAU </strong><br />
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cbe9cf80d51d9a1742b8d0b6dd54d676" target="_blank">this page of the wiki, </a>and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to contribute to this discussion. PM&amp;C are using this information to develop a commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in our recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia </strong><br />
After Monday&#8217;s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across Australia. The <a href="https://opengovernment.org.au/" target="_blank">Australian Open Government Partnership Network</a> (civil society) also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this process especially those of you involved in Monday&#8217;s event. PM&amp;C and I have been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you have shown to Open Government in Australia. It&#8217;s been an honour getting to know you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been capturing <a href="../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html#comment-373" target="_blank">what I have learned about Open Government in Australia.</a> This input will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to include.</p>
<p>To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&amp;C, the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of these uses of your personal information, please complete <a href="https://app.surveygizmo.com/builder/build/id/2719702" target="_blank">this 2 minute survey</a> so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the 14th May.</p>

			<p>Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">wiki</a>. This marks the end of <a href="../../contribute/index.html" target="_blank">Stage 2 of our engagement process</a>, which was designed to raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31<sup>st</sup> March.</p>
<p>We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations. The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and commitment to open government from our community.</p>
<p>We have now commenced <a href="../../contribute/index.html" target="_blank">Stage 3 </a>of the process to develop the National Action Plan (NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in Canberra this Monday, the 11<sup>th</sup> April 2016.</p>
<p>During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National Action Plan, completing <a href="../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html" class="broken_link"><u>commitment templates</u></a> provided by the international<a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"> Open Government Partnership. </a>Representatives from civil society and government agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this process.</p>
<p>This week PM&amp;C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667" target="_blank">wiki</a> page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology sections of the National Action Plan document. A <a href="../updates/index.html">blog update</a> was also sent out by PM&amp;C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions received and from their own research and analysis.</p>
<p>During Monday&#8217;s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the NAP.</p>
<p>All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-create a draft commitment template, PM&amp;C has agreed to brief nominated lead agencies about them after the event.</p>
<p>The agenda for this workshop is available <a href="../../files/2016/04/Agenda-cocreation-workshop.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">here</a>. The opening of this workshop will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see the opening and ask questions of our speakers. <a href="https://t.co/TrhH6d1aZc">Here is the link to the GoogeHangout </a>&#8211; a public event anyone can attend online.</p>
<p>We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the workshop next week.</p>

			<p>If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.</p>
<p>The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.</p>
<p>I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.</p>
<p>The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>13:00 &#8211; 14:00 Fiscal Transparency</li>
<li>14:30 &#8211; 15:30 Fostering innovation</li>
<li>15:30 &#8211; 16:30 Freedom of Information</li>
<li>16:30 &#8211; 17:30 Government Integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>12:00 &#8211; 13:00 Open Data</li>
<li>13:00 &#8211; 14:00 Public Service Delivery</li>
<li>14:30 &#8211; 15:30 Resource Management</li>
<li>15:30 &#8211; 16:30 Public Participation</li>
<li>17:00 &#8211; 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU</li>
</ul>
<p>I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.</p>
<p>I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between 11am &#8211; 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.</p>

			<p>Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have been suggested and I&#8217;m aware of a few more currently being drafted.</p>
<p>I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an interest in <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration">Open Government Principles or the OGP Grand Challenges</a> so they can help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.</p>
<p>The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218 people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with 87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a <a href="../../files/2015/10/Introduction_to_OGPAU.pdf">one page Introduction to the OGPAU </a>document and <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf">How to Suggest an Action template with tips</a> to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks – just let me know how I can help.</p>
<p>I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.</p>
<p>I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact each other. I have contacted PM&amp;C’s privacy team to confirm this approach whether this requires your consent.</p>
<p>As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want to help.</p>
<p>Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public participation industry across the country. I have been working with the Australasian division <a href="https://www.iap2.org.au/">International Association for Public Participation (IAP2)</a> who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.</p>
<p>I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven&#8217;t suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so, so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.</p>
<p>Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&amp;C can discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf" target="_blank">How to Suggest an Action </a>document should help, or you could look at the <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=42b1a61b3db11a2a49c7002f630fa58c" target="_blank">wiki</a> for ideas to build upon. PM&amp;C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.</p>
<p>The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested. I&#8217;m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about <a href="../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html" target="_blank">What I have learned about Open Gov in Australia </a>which I will update as I continue to engage.</p>
<h2>Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline</h2>
<p>My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key <em>themes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Public Participation</em> –increased input into both policy and agenda setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff</li>
<li><em>Government Integrity</em> – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption, parliamentary openness</li>
<li><em>Freedom of Information</em> – review of the act, role of the commissioners, privacy, copyright review</li>
<li><em>Fiscal Transparency</em> – open budget, political donations</li>
<li><em>Public Service Delivery</em> – how Gov work with community and industry, how citizens find services</li>
<li><em>Resources Management</em> – sustainable development, working with indigenous communities, see also <em>OpenData</em> and <em>Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency</em></li>
<li><em>Open Data</em> – standardised formats, public register and open raw data, publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource and extractive industry data</li>
<li><em>Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency</em> &#8211; extractive industry data and transparency initiative</li>
<li><em>Fostering innovation</em> – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs, support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver services</li>
<li><em>Engagement for OGP</em> – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see suggested actions in more details on the<a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html"> WIKI.</a></p>
<h2>Actions you have inspired me to take</h2>
<p>Based on your input to date I am now:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Supporting</em> a number of organisations with development of their submissions</li>
<li><em>Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills</em> – e.g. My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals to the International OGP Working Groups.</li>
<li><em>Co-hosting events</em> – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number of the organisations listed.</li>
<li><em>Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference &#8211;</em> will now be a teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar ideas</li>
<li><em>Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups </em></li>
<li><em>Researching similar actions</em> outlined in Action Plans prepared by other countries</li>
<li><em>Investigating privacy and consent requirements </em>for publishing stakeholder details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.</li>
<li><em>Researching ongoing engagement forums</em> being used in other Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others you like.</li>
<li><em>Researching OGP NAP review reports</em> to understand how Australia might be assessed and what actions should include.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.</p>

			<p>I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government initiatives inside Government across Australia.</p>
<p>I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.</p>

			<p><strong>OGP engagement update &#8211; 1st March </strong><br />
<em>by Amelia Loye engage2 </em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) to engage civil society in Open Government.</p>
<p>I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and email update.</p>
<p>You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live on the <a href="../../contribute/get-involved/index.html" target="_blank">website.</a></p>
<p>I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at <a href="mailto:amelia@engage2.com.au">amelia@engage2.com.au</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging your networks: </strong>I have been working with a range of different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open Government Working Groups.</p>
<p><strong>Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:</strong> The document is being drafted <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">live</a><a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html" target="_blank"> on the wiki</a> so you can observe and comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across the Country.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with your input:</strong> I collate all input received and report back weekly to PM&amp;C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.</p>
<p>Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open Government Partnership, PM&amp;C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your input to date.</p>
<p>As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.</p>
<p>Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Amelia Loye<br />

			<p>The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress, and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.</p>
<p>We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.</p>
<h2>How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event</strong> (14 December 2015 – 28 February 2016):</p>
<p>Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government. We also encourage you to explore the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"><u><span style="color: #0066cc">OGP website</span></u></a> including some of the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries"><u><span style="color: #0066cc">actions plans from other governments</span></u></a> and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">https://ogpau.wikispaces.com/</a></li>
<li>A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to the consultation. Please subscribe to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P"><u><span style="color: #0066cc">OGP Au mailing list</span></u></a> to indicate your interest in attending.

			<p>The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.</p>
<p>This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.</p>
<h2>How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History</strong> (17 November 2015 – 11 December 2015):</p>
<p>A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">OGP website</a> including some of the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries">actions plans from other governments</a>. This is Australia&#8217;s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and 2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can also indicate your interest by joining the <a href="http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P">OGPau mailing list</a> and ticking the information sessions option, and we&#8217;ll notify you when they are open for registration.</li>
<li>Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.</li>
<li>Adding feedback to the draft <a href="../../background/index.html">Background page</a> comments.</li>
<li>Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.</li>
<li>Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we need to get the framework right first.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../../national-action-plan/index.html">full consultation timeline</a> on the National Action Plan Consultation page.</p>
<p>Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below for this stage. Please also find further information <a href="../../about-ogp/index.html">About OGP</a>..</p>
<p>We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of others.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pia Waugh</em></strong> (OGPau National Action Plan Coordinator, PM&amp;C)</p>
<h2>Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia</h2>
<p>Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.</p>
<p>A couple of example is provided to kick things off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.</li>
<li>Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan</h2>
<p>Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan. The <a href="../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_actionplan_guide%20FINAL_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">OGP National Action Plan template</a> is available le online and a useful guide though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and contributions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> &#8211; an overview of the Australian Government&#8217;s commitment, the grand challenges addressed in the NAP (<em>improved public services</em> and <em>more effectively managing public resources</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Vision</strong> &#8211; the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward</li>
<li><strong>NAP Development Process</strong> &#8211; the process of developing the Australian Government National Action Plan</li>
<li><strong>Open Government Efforts to Date</strong> &#8211; background of open government in Australia</li>
<li><strong>Overview of commitments</strong> &#8211; an overview of the commitments, then broken down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see <a href="../../national-action-plan/index.html" rel="nofollow">NAP page on ogpau website</a> for detail)</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong> &#8211; wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported</li>
</ol>
<p>Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.</p>
<h2>Efforts to date &#8211; a background of open government in Australia</h2>
<p>Please add your comments to the draft <a href="../../background/index.html">Background page</a> for any additional efforts to date.</p>
