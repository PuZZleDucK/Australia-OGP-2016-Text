CDATA[Hi Henare. Thanks for posting the links Henare. I invited everyone who
had suggested an action under a theme to attend and posted the link to register
on the wiki pages for each theme. These events are being held to encourage and
complement three way engagement on the wiki. I am also adding summaries of
discussions on each theme pages of the wiki to boost three way engagement. The
intent is to be as available as I can to those of you suggesting actions before
submissions close Thursday. My team scheduled the Ongoing Engagement session as
our first event, but I thought it should be last based on theme based
discussions so needed to modify in eventbrite before posting the link. Those
who have suggested actions under this theme received an email invitation on
Thursday. I've been unwell this weekend and in teleconferences most of today so
forgot to post it on the theme - thanks for the reminder. Amelia]]>

CDATA[>I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you
might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
Gosh. There's late notice and then there's late notice :-( I appreciate getting
an email invite (since I didn't hear about this any other way) but the email
was sent after close of business on a 4 day long Easter weekend for a call
happening the day everyone's back from holidays (not to mention 2 days out from
the deadline). I'm very disappointed to be unable to participate due to this
lack of notice. >I have also posted links under each themes in the wiki so you
