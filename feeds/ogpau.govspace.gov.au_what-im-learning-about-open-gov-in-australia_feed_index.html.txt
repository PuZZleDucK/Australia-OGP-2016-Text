CDATA[The list appears comprehensive-ish, and forgive me if I have missed the
mark when it comes to accessing government records, information and data. All
jurisdictions will have an Records/Archives authority. Each of which provides
access to records that are in jurisdictions open access period. Open access
periods vary in each state and territory - but it still it is an opportunity
and function that has been over-looked in this list. Federal/Commonwealth:
National Archives of Australia - (and reading through the site, I have seen
that they have provided some comment on some parts) Under the Archives Act
1983, the National Archives has two main roles: - to preserve Australiaâs
most valuable government records and encourage their use by the public; and -
to promote good records management by Australian Government agencies. In
fulfilling these responsibilities, we ensure that Australians have access to a
national archival collection so they may better understand their heritage and
democracy (taken directly from their website - about us) They have a records
search function and also areading room which provides appropriate access to
commonewealth held records to australian community. http://www.naa.gov.au/
