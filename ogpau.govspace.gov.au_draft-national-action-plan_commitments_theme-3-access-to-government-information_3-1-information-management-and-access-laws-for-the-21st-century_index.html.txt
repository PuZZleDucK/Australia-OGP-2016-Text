3.1 – Information management and access laws for the 21st century {#information-management-and-access-laws-for-the-21st-century .entry-title}
=================================================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will ensure our information access laws are modern and appropriate
for the digital information age.*

**Objective\
**Australia will consider options for reforms to the framework for
managing and accessing government information, including the Freedom of
Information Act 1982 (FOI Act), the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act)
and, where relevant, the Privacy Act 1988 (with primary focus on the
Archives Act and FOI Act), as well as policies and practices relating to
information access and management.

**Status Quo\
**In 2010, the Australian Government passed reforms to the FOI Act as
part of a broader plan to improve transparency and to encourage public
engagement in decision making. The 2010 reforms also included the
introduction of the Information Publication Scheme, which requires
agencies to provide a broad range of information on their websites, and
amendments to the Archives Act to reduce the open access period for
Commonwealth records from 30 to 20 years over a 10 year period.

There have since been a number of reviews recommending changes to the
FOI Act, including Dr Allan Hawke’s Review of Freedom of Information
Laws and the Belcher Red Tape Review. Among other things, the Belcher
Red Tape Review recommended the Attorney-General’s Department “begin
work with relevant entities to scope and develop a simpler and more
coherent legislative framework for managing and accessing government
information during its life-cycle in a digital environment through
staged reforms, commencing with legislation regulating archives.”

The core frameworks of Australia’s information access laws (in
particular the FOI Act and the Archives Act) have not been substantially
altered since enacted in the early 1980s, when government operated in a
paper-based environment. It is therefore appropriate to consider how
access to government information is best managed into the future within
the context of digital government.

**Ambition\
**To develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework for
managing and accessing government information within the context of
digital government, supported by efficient and effective policies and
practices.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **access to
information** and **public accountability **by:

-   ensuring government information access laws are modern and capable
    of meeting the demands of the digital age;
-   increasing awareness of public access rights to government
    information; and
-   improving efficiency of processing access to information requests.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   Increasing Public Integrity
-   Improving Public Services

**Timeframes\
**Early 2017 – Mid 2019

**Lead agency\
**Attorney-General’s Department

**Other actors involved**\
*Government:* The National Archives of Australia, the Office of the
Australian Information Commissioner and the Department of the Prime
Minister and Cabinet

*Non-government: *Non-government organisations, archivists, academics
and researchers, journalists, Law Council of Australia and
state/territory information commissioners

**Milestones**

1.  Develop options paper setting out alternative models for information
    access laws.
    -   Early – Mid 2017

2.  Public consultation on options paper.
    -   Mid 2017

3.  Propose preferred model for framework informed by
    consultation outcomes.
    -   Late 2017

4.  Implementation of proposed model (if required).
    -   Late 2017 – Mid 2019
