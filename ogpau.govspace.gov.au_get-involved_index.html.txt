**OGP engagement update – 1st March**\
*by Amelia Loye engage2*

It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister
and Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.

I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and
organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and
encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really
amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share
what I learn with you in this blog and email update.

You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action
Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement
strategy are now live on the
[website.](../contribute/get-involved/index.html)

I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to
continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders
passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene
conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I
would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage
engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on
phone 0411960585 or by email at <amelia@engage2.com.au>.

**Engaging your networks:** I have been working with a range of
different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government
Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working
with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions
with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have
not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also
connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions
in areas that interest you through the International Open Government
Working Groups.

**Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:** The document is
being drafted [live](../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)[on the
wiki](../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html) so you can observe and
comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and
workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love
to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across
the Country.

**What’s happening with your input:** I collate all input received and
report back weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and
face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and
email submissions.

Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the
Open Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a
summary of your input to date.

As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki
so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal
submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as
they are received.

Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look
forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the
coming weeks.

Amelia Loye\
