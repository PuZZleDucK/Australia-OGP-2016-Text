****** Engagement update – 1st March ******

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.

            Great idea Rosie. I’ll promote this through my engagements too.
