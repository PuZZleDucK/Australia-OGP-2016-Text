<p>In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki and other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy to read, in line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is available for download at <a href="../../files/2016/04/National-Action-Plan-DRAFT-v5-For-Release.docx" rel="">National Action Plan DRAFT v5 &#8211; For Release</a></p>
<p>We have also posted the text onto the wiki at <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667" target="_blank">http://ogpau.wikispaces.com/Draft+text+of+the+National+Action+Plan+-+5+April+2016</a> for your comments and feedback prior to the meeting on Monday.</p>

			<p>If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.</p>
<p>The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.</p>
<p>I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.</p>
<p>The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>13:00 &#8211; 14:00 Fiscal Transparency</li>
<li>14:30 &#8211; 15:30 Fostering innovation</li>
<li>15:30 &#8211; 16:30 Freedom of Information</li>
<li>16:30 &#8211; 17:30 Government Integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>12:00 &#8211; 13:00 Open Data</li>
<li>13:00 &#8211; 14:00 Public Service Delivery</li>
<li>14:30 &#8211; 15:30 Resource Management</li>
<li>15:30 &#8211; 16:30 Public Participation</li>
<li>17:00 &#8211; 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU</li>
</ul>
<p>I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.</p>
<p>I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between 11am &#8211; 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.</p>

			<p>We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=400b0cddf5e7a338daf5895375da5a64">wiki. </a>Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st March.</p>
<p><strong>Save the date!</strong> Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.</p>
<p>Need help? This <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf">how to Suggest an Action document provides some tips</a>. It’s an easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.</p>
<p>In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=3fd642b71c09fa7485cd3a6a758f861e">Engagement for OGP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=99b2404d03fa9b13d367b3703c0c7c24">Fiscal Transparency</a></li>

</ul>
<p>We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each action suggested.</p>
<p>Toby and the Open Government team at PM&amp;C have been discussing these themes with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to get involved. PM&amp;C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the 11th April workshop.</p>
<h2>Some questions that emerged during engagement last week</h2>
<ul>
<li>After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?</li>
<li>How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of the Grand Challenges?</li>
<li>What happened to the proposed teleconference?</li>
<li>How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responses to your questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Cocreation &#8211;</em> The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team, but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP <u><a href="../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">commitment templates</a> </u>with you.</p>
<p><em>Grand challenges &#8211;</em> The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will share more about Government’s position on this soon.</p>
<p><em>Teleconference &#8211; </em>I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities, differences and priorities before the 11th April event.</p>
<p><em>Working together to prioritise actions</em> &#8211; We need to work together to prioritise suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment on actions on the wiki &#8211; I will start asking questions discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.</li>
<li>In a theme based teleconference &#8211; I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions that you have inspired me to take</h2>
<p>Based on your input to date I am now:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Encouraging theme based engagement </em>– I will be running teleconferences with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about this.</li>
<li><em>Encouraging feedback from others on actions – </em><em>actions have now been themed into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise with you at the workshop. </em></li>
<li><em>Connecting Australians to the </em><em><u><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups" target="_blank">working groups</a> </u></em><em>and Open Government Partnership Support Unit, </em><em>Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Bas</em><em>u</em><em>: <a href="mailto:shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org">shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org</a></em></li>
<li><em>Investigating privacy and consent requirements </em>for publishing stakeholder details – I am still pursing this with PM&amp;C.</li>
<li><em>Researching ongoing engagement forums</em> being used in other Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian Open Government Partnership Networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.</p>
<p>Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.</p>

			<p>Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have been suggested and I&#8217;m aware of a few more currently being drafted.</p>
<p>I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an interest in <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration">Open Government Principles or the OGP Grand Challenges</a> so they can help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.</p>
<p>The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218 people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with 87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a <a href="../../files/2015/10/Introduction_to_OGPAU.pdf">one page Introduction to the OGPAU </a>document and <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf">How to Suggest an Action template with tips</a> to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks – just let me know how I can help.</p>
<p>I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.</p>
<p>I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact each other. I have contacted PM&amp;C’s privacy team to confirm this approach whether this requires your consent.</p>
<p>As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want to help.</p>
<p>Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public participation industry across the country. I have been working with the Australasian division <a href="https://www.iap2.org.au/">International Association for Public Participation (IAP2)</a> who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.</p>
<p>I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven&#8217;t suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so, so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.</p>
<p>Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&amp;C can discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf" target="_blank">How to Suggest an Action </a>document should help, or you could look at the <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cc5e5d1fa2e5184eaee6859f30c7c791" target="_blank">wiki</a> for ideas to build upon. PM&amp;C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.</p>
<p>The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested. I&#8217;m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about <a href="../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html" target="_blank">What I have learned about Open Gov in Australia </a>which I will update as I continue to engage.</p>
<h2>Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline</h2>
<p>My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key <em>themes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Public Participation</em> –increased input into both policy and agenda setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff</li>
<li><em>Government Integrity</em> – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption, parliamentary openness</li>
<li><em>Freedom of Information</em> – review of the act, role of the commissioners, privacy, copyright review</li>
<li><em>Fiscal Transparency</em> – open budget, political donations</li>
<li><em>Public Service Delivery</em> – how Gov work with community and industry, how citizens find services</li>
<li><em>Resources Management</em> – sustainable development, working with indigenous communities, see also <em>OpenData</em> and <em>Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency</em></li>
<li><em>Open Data</em> – standardised formats, public register and open raw data, publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource and extractive industry data</li>
<li><em>Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency</em> &#8211; extractive industry data and transparency initiative</li>
<li><em>Fostering innovation</em> – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs, support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver services</li>
<li><em>Engagement for OGP</em> – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see suggested actions in more details on the<a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html"> WIKI.</a></p>

<li><em>Investigating privacy and consent requirements </em>for publishing stakeholder details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.</li>
<li><em>Researching ongoing engagement forums</em> being used in other Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others you like.</li>
<li><em>Researching OGP NAP review reports</em> to understand how Australia might be assessed and what actions should include.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.</p>

			<p>I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government initiatives inside Government across Australia.</p>

			<p><strong>OGP engagement update &#8211; 1st March </strong><br />
<em>by Amelia Loye engage2 </em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) to engage civil society in Open Government.</p>
<p>I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and email update.</p>
<p>You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live on the <a href="../../contribute/get-involved/index.html" target="_blank">website.</a></p>
<p>I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at <a href="mailto:amelia@engage2.com.au">amelia@engage2.com.au</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging your networks: </strong>I have been working with a range of different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open Government Working Groups.</p>
<p><strong>Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:</strong> The document is being drafted <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">live</a><a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html" target="_blank"> on the wiki</a> so you can observe and comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across the Country.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with your input:</strong> I collate all input received and report back weekly to PM&amp;C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.</p>
<p>Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open Government Partnership, PM&amp;C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your input to date.</p>
<p>As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.</p>
<p>Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.</p>

			<p>This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open Government Network on February 2 2016.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Australian Open Government network</strong></p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).</p>
<p>The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of priorities for consideration.</p>
<p>Current Steering Committee members are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair</li>
<li>Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)</li>
<li>Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)</li>
<li>Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash University)</li>
<li>Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)</li>
<li>Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)</li>
<li>Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)</li>
<li>Peter Timmins, Convener</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the process of doing so.</p>
<p>At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.</p>
<p>The Network has a webpage at <a href="http://www.aogpn.net/" target="_blank">www.aogpn.net</a> and will shortly have a more comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.</p>
<p>The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the government moves ahead on this important initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Low key initiative</strong><br />
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of Australia&#8217;s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.</p>
<p>While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members of the public.</p>
<p>While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be substantial national engagement activity.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p>While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily available on the OGP&#8217;s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation website.</p>
<p>As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to public attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP membership process in mainstream media.</p>
<p>The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national campaign of engagement.</p>
<p>Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials published online. However these materials are not readily available to interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.</p>
<p>In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a challenge even for those aware of the process.</p>
<p>While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely taking place.</p>
<p>It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.</p>
<p><strong>General approach</strong><br />
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include Public Integrity.</p>
<p>Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.</p>
<p>The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and timeline.</p>
<p>The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states, territories and local government must be part of the open government journey. The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.</p>
<p>The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.</p>
<p>The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister&#8217;s proclamation of &#8220;Australia&#8217;s long proud tradition of open and transparent government.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan, wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”</p>
<p><strong>Vision and Background</strong><br />
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background material.</p>
<p>At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti corruption matters.</p>
<p>The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.</p>
<p>Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan required by the convention.</p>
<p>The Attorney general&#8217;s Department website<br />
<a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx</a> makes much of Australia&#8217;s leadership role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.</p>
<p>The Plan states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our government agencies, policies, and officials implement international best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement, open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public officials as issues which merit particular attention.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption. Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset disclosure frameworks&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong><br />
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the consultation proceeds.</p>
<p>Please publish this submission on the Open Government Partnership Australia website.</p>

Chairman, Steering Committee<br />

			<p>Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by making significant headway on a number of priorities.</p>
<p>This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog and mailing list.</p>
<p>The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and opportunities to get more involved.</p>
<p>One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.</p>
<p>We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside Civil Society in this process.</p>
<p>At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal Openness,</li>
<li>Legislative Openness,</li>
<li>Access to Information,</li>
<li>Open Data and</li>
<li>Openness in Natural Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>More information is available at <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups</a></p>
<p>If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send us an email to <a href="mailto:ogp@pmc.gov.au">ogp@pmc.gov.au</a>.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the Australian Government can deliver and report against.</p>
<p>You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">https://ogpau.wikispaces.com</a> .</p>

			<p>I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we have created an email address (<a href="http://ogp@pmc.gov.au/">ogp@pmc.gov.au</a>) as an additional communication and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.  Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (<a href="../../faqs/index.html">https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/</a>).</p>
<p>As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions.  Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency; Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress can be measured.</p>
<p>There are a wealth of resources located at <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/landing">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/landing</a> which provide details of the existing commitments developed by other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom of this email for more information on how to contribute.</p>
<h2>Updates from the coordination team</h2>
<p>As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.</p>
<p>I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.</p>
<p>Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email) will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.</p>
