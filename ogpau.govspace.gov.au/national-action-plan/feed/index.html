		<description><![CDATA[With regard to models for such an enterprise, I can only endorse the NZ comparison and strongly recommend that you look at the UK initiatives in relation to open government and open data. Placing the open data strategy within the ambit of the National Archives. along with Her Majestys&#039; Stationery Office,  focuses on government information across all sectors - creation, use, reuse and preservation.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alysha - I just noticed this comment had no response. 
State and Territories are also welcome to submit their own applications to join the sub-national pilot program recently introduced by the International Open Government Partnership: &#060;http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/subnational-government-pilot-program&#034;. 
I am engaging with State Government Open Government teams across the Country, inviting them to submit an action to the National Action Plan. I have been in touch with Gail from Premiers in SA. 
I&#039;ll send you an email so you have my contact details too.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pia,
As I mentioned above public services would be improved by cutting Commonwealth Public servant numbers. With nothing useful to do the redundant public servants  hold endless talkfests and suggest and  impose layers of regulations that suffocate private companies from growing GDP,growing  employment  and being productive. For example. why does the Commonwealth have 4000 plus servants in the department of Health and Ageing  which is really a state responsibility?
This is why Australia is heading inevitably into a 2016 recession despite excessive government spending  temporarily propping up the economy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bill, thanks for the comment but it is worth noting that there is no national action plan at this stage, it is being developed over the coming 5 months, so we are curious about what you are commenting on. If you have any specific ideas about how to improve open government, please feel free to contribute to the consultation.

Warm regards,
Pia Waugh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This national action plan is so convoluted and intangible it reads like a Greens initiative . All flourishes but completely hollow.
To advance Australia our bloated commonwealth and state public servants must be drastically reduced in number. The Australian newspaper`s research  today showed their employment conditions to be so much better than the private sector.
 Furthermore overseas studies show that for every public or quasi public sector job create between three to six jobs are lost in the private secots due to subsequent regulations and costs.
Turnbull`s failure to cut or at least freeze service numbers indicates an unbelievable oversight or psychological capture by the Canberrs public service.
Real actions not grandiose statements are needed as we plunge further down the steepening deficit slope.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t help but be extremely wary of this process.
Having been involved in Senate Inquiries that achieve absolutely nothing in the past, even though the majority want change. I can&#039;t see myself wasting time doing submissions that achieve nothing!
Australia&#039;s financial position is deteriorating quickly and it is unlikely the government can pick winners. Private enterprise is the only thing that can save our country, a National Action Plan run by Government won&#039;t achieve much at all. Government just needs to get out of the way, but they won&#039;t until the economy collapses or the global bankers turn the money off?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.
 However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by this approach to ‘engagement’]]></description>
