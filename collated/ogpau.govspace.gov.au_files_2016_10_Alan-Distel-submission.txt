Dear Mr Turnbull and cabinet,
I have just had a preliminary read of the Plan and am impressed. I am impressed because if it is
thoroughly implemented it would have vastly significant changes for the better. I am actually very
curious to know if the USA is one of the 70 countries that have joined up. I am curious because if
they have it seems to me that they have a vast amount of work to do judging by the state of their
"democracy". Mind you there are still many features of there system that leave ours well behind
such as decent penalties for those who violate of environment laws such for car emissions cheats
like VW. We don't even have laws that set a standard.
Any way there problem seems to be that the fat cats have had it so so good that the people are
looking to start a revolution that could virtually destroy the country.
In our case the situation is not significantly better. It is obvious that many of the things that you are
doing or not doing will have to change if you are going to comply with the aspirations implicit in the
document.
To my mind the most serious neglect is that Climate Change is NOT being taken seriously. I keep an
eye on what is happening here and overseas and our performance is at the "D" level. I and many
others are getting more and more impatient, no angry, that some in our government are still talking
absolute nonsense, totally ignoring the advice and comment from all people regardless of their
qualifications and instead continue to spout garbage that does not stand up to rigorous and
thoughtful criticism based on experience and knowledge.
