Ahead of the upcoming final stage of consultation on Australia’s first Open
Government National Action Plan, PM&C is releasing engage2’s report on the
public consultation undertaken between November 2015 and April 2016.
engage2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by PM&C
to help design and lead a public consultation process up until April 2016. The
process is summarised in the OGPAU_Engagement_Report,  which also outlines the
outputs of the process, engage2’s lessons learned and recommendations to PM&C.
PM&C would like to thank Amelia Loye and the engage2 team for their efforts and
hard work.
The upcoming public consultation period on the full draft of the National
Action Plan is the final stage in this year-long consultation process to
develop Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan. Stay tuned to
