****** Interim Working Group for Australia’s National Action Plan – Expressions
of Interest ******
Posted on August_18,_2016  by  ogpteam
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.
