***** Public meetings and other awareness raising activities *****
    * Four public information sessions were held in November 2015 to provide an
      overview of the Open Government Partnership and the process to develop
      Australia’s first National Action Plan. The sessions, held in Sydney,
      Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, were attended by a total of 162 people,
      with a further 45 people watching the livestreams online.
    * The OGP Australia blog and an email distribution list were established to
      provide public updates on progress and to inform stakeholders of
      engagement opportunities.
    * The hashtag #OGPau was created to discuss the project on social media,
      including through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s
      Twitter account.
***** Seeking ideas for the National Action Plan *****
    * A wiki (ogpau.wikispaces.com) was created to provide an interactive and
      collaborative forum for stakeholders to suggest commitments that could be
      included in the National Action Plan. Almost 1000 people visited the wiki
      between February and May 2016, and around 200 suggestions were put
      forward (all available online on the wiki and blog, including a summary).
    * On 12 April 2016, a workshop was held in Canberra to discuss and
      prioritise the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. The
      workshop was attended by 63 people, with a mix of government, civil
      society, OGP Support Unit and other participants.
    * 14 commitment templates were drafted during the workshop, covering areas
      such as open data, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protection, beneficial
      ownership, public participation and the Extractive Industries
      Transparency Initiative. The templates were further considered within
      government and informed the drafting of the National Action Plan.
***** Government engagement *****
An Inter-Departmental Committee was established to ensure the interests of
Australian Government agencies were considered in the development of the
National Action Plan. This Committee was chaired by the Department of the Prime

The Committee met four times and also considered material out-of-session,
including the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. Government
ministers were also briefed on commitments that fall within their area of
responsibility and on the Open Government Partnership more broadly.
***** Interim Working Group *****
An Interim Working Group was established in August 2016 to provide input and
help inform the drafting of the National Action Plan. The Group comprised equal
representation of senior government officials and stakeholder representatives:
    * Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair): Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime
      Minister and Cabinet;
    * Ms Fiona McLeod (co-chair): President-elect of the Law Council of
      Australia;
    * Dr Stein Helgeby: Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance;
    * Mr Iain Anderson: Deputy Secretary, Attorney-General’s Department;
    * Mr Timothy Pilgrim: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting Australian
      Information Commissioner;
    * Ms Meghan Quinn: First Assistant Secretary, the Treasury;
    * Ms Anne Lyons: Assistant Director-General, National Archives of
      Australia;
    * The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the Accountability
      Round Table;
    * Ms Maree Adshead: CEO of Open Data Institute Queensland;
    * Mr Peter Timmins: Interim Convenor of the Australian OGP Civil Society
      Network;
    * Mr Mark Zirnsak: Director of Justice and International Mission, Synod of
      Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia; and
    * Ms Katherine Szuminska: Co-Founder and Director of the OpenAustralia
      Foundation.
The NSW Information Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Tydd, also sat as a non-voting
jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire to build stronger
relationships with the states on open government matters.
The group worked together to identify and explore in detail the potential
commitments for the National Action Plan, building on ideas put forward from
earlier consultations. The group also considered the text of other parts of the
National Action Plan, and the approach to broader consultation and engagement
on the draft Plan. Members also facilitated targeted consultation with their
wider networks throughout the process.
In addition to regular teleconferences and email correspondence, the Group held
three face-to-face meetings in Canberra, and a workshop in Sydney, which
included an hour discussion with the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital
Transformation, the Hon Angus Taylor MP.
Agenda papers, meeting minutes and the outcomes of discussions with the Group
have been posted regularly on the OGP Australia blog.
