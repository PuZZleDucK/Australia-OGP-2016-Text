****** Submission_from_the_Australian_Open_Government_Network_(AOGPN) ******
Posted on February_3,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood

This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open
Government Network on February 2 2016.
===============================================================================
 
Australian Open Government network
I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and
organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of
Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and
participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on
areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true
spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of
priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
    * Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
    * Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
    * Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
    * Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash
      University)
    * Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
    * Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
    * Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
    * Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the
process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil
Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more
comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to
contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.
The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the
government moves ahead on this important initiative.
Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how
government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of
Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.
While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic
and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage
participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members
of the public.
While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information
sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and
entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be
substantial national engagement activity.
The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the
OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been
no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his
Cabinet Ministers.
While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs
announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily
available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime
Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation
website.
As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to
public attention.
Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.
The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice
were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national
campaign of engagement.
Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in
recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials
published online. However these materials are not readily available to
interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.
In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a
challenge even for those aware of the process.
While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there
is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely
taking place.
It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at
risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of
Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of
insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.
General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced
it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include
Public Integrity.
Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of
consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing
to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have
been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.
The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the
necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP
initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the
lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society
together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision
making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself
with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs
provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that
Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and
timeline.
The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil
society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for
the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.
The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states,
territories and local government must be part of the open government journey.
The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open
government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian
Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a
discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.
The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future
of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that
should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal
of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.
The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s
proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent
government.”
As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan,
wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go
through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”
Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background
material.
At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of
the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN
General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti
corruption matters.
The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight
governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.
Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan
required by the convention.
The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/
Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership
role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.
The Plan states:
     “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our
     government agencies, policies, and officials implement international
     best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The
     (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement,
     open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public
     officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public
     officials as issues which merit particular attention.”
The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:
     “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
     committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
     corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-
     Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on
     Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our
     companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption.
     Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is
     essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open
     Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in
     Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset
     disclosure frameworks…”
The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level
Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for
Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data
Principles.
Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the
consultation proceeds.

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
