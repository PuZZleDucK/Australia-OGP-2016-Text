1. Think big
a. Define the problem – why is it a problem, who does it affect, who else cares?
b. What would the solution look like – what is the outcome you are trying to achieve?
c. Does it relate to one of the Grand Challenges?
Improving Public Services – such as health, education, criminal justice, water, electricity,
telecommunications, fostering public service improvement, fostering private sector innovation.
Management of Public Resources – data, measures that address budgets and procurement,
natural resources, foreign assistance
How would it increase?
• Accountability
• Transparency
• Public participation
2. Then think small
a. About actions - what needs to happen to achieve that outcome?
b. How can it be delivered? What is the first step?
c. What can be achieved in two years? The action has to be delivered within two years so our Government
can report achievement or progress against it.
Is this something the Australian Government can do something about?
• Who in the Federal Government could make this happen?
• Consider the responsibilities of Australian Government
Do they need to work with others to achieve it?
• If so, who? Who else cares about this? Who else has responsibility over these matters?
• Is this person or organisation Government or will work with private or the community sector?
How? Does anything need to change to make this happen?
