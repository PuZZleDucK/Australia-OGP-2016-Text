****** Commitments ******
This National Action Plan consists of an ambitious package of 14 commitments.
Taken together, these actions will advance transparency, accountability, public
participation and technological innovation in Australia over the next two
years.
The Government will continue to engage publicly to identify new opportunities
to promote open government. New commitments may either be added to this
National Action Plan, or embedded in our second National Action Plan due in
2018.
