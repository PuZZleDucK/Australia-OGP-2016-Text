The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.

Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://
      ogpau.wikispaces.com/
    * A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air
      ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to
      the consultation. Please subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list to indicate
      your interest in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to
      present their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where
      and when this forum will take place will be published on this website
      closer to the date.

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.
The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:
Brisbane:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)

****** Consultation_Stage_1:_Preparation,_Framework_and_History ******
Posted on November_17,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.

***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****
Please add your comments to the draft Background_page for any additional
efforts to date.
