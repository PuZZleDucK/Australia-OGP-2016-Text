****** Developing this plan ******
The National Action Plan has been drafted through a process of consultation and
collaboration between government, non-government organisations (including the
Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network), the public and
the private sector.
Over the past year, we undertook a number of activities to explore the breadth
of Australian views on the spectrum of open government issues.
    * Raising awareness: public meetings were held in four capital cities in
      late 2015 to raise awareness of Australia’s membership of the Open
      Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first
      National Action Plan. Additional awareness raising activities were
      undertaken through social media, government websites, teleconferences and
      webinars, and email mailing lists.
    * Seeking ideas: a formal consultation process ran from December 2015 to
      April 2016 to seek suggestions on potential commitments for the National
      Action Plan. This included a formal submission process, teleconferences
      with stakeholders, and a workshop with over 60 participants in April 2016
      to help prioritise potential commitments for the Plan. All timeframes for
      consultation and submissions were published online.
    * Drafting the National Action Plan: an Interim Working Group, comprising
      equal representation of government officials and non-government members,
      was established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the
      drafting of the National Action Plan, building on earlier consultations.
This engagement has helped shape the National Action Plan and the open
government priorities for the next two years. More details about engagement
activities are provided at Appendix A.
