******
Posted on October_31,_2016  by  ogpteam
UPDATE 8/11/2016:
Following stakeholder feedback, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet is extending the deadline for public submissions on Australia’s first
Open Government National Action Plan to 5pm AEDT on Friday 18 November 2016.
The Government will consider changes in response to public comments before
submitting the Plan to the Open Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
We look forward to hearing your views.
===============================================================================
The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever Open
Government National Action Plan for public consultation.
This is the final round of consultation in a year-long process to develop the
National Action Plan.
The draft Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * DOCX: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * HTML: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
A fact sheet on consultation and the Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
    * DOCX: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
The draft Plan sets out an ambitious agenda for the next two years, focused on:
    * transparency and accountability in business
    * open data and digital transformation
    * access to government information
    * integrity in the public sector
    * public participation and engagement
The creation of a National Action Plan is part of the commitment the Australian
Government made when it became a member of the Open_Government_Partnership.
Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft Plan
through a variety of consultation activities which started in November 2015. An
Interim_Working_Group of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders
was also established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the
commitments.
The Open Government Partnership sets deadlines for submitting National Action
Plans. The Government will consider public comments and potential changes to
the Plan, before submitting it to the Open Government Partnership before the
end of 2016.
How_to_provide_feedback

Consultation_page
The focus of this round of consultation is on the details of the proposed
commitments in the Plan (e.g. Are there potential implementation issues? Is the
level of ambition appropriate?) Consultation was undertaken earlier in 2016 to
seek ideas on potential commitments for the Plan.
Public information sessions are also being hosted jointly by government and
civil society representatives at selected locations around the country. Please

      chosen by the Government from the Disability Community to represent
      people’s with a disability interest?
