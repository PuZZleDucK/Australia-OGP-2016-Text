****** About the OGP ******
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a multilateral initiative and was
launched in September 2011 by the United States President, Barack Obama, and
the Brazilian President, Dilma Roussef.
The OPG was founded by eight countries – Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway,
Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. The eight
founding OGP countries have been joined by a further 61 countries bringing the
total to 69_participating_countries.
The OGP aims to secure commitments from governments to promote transparency,
increase civic participation, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to
make government more open, effective, and accountable. The OGP also fosters new
ways for citizens and governments to working together to solve common
problems. In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, the OGP is overseen
by a steering committee of governments and civil society organisations.
OGP member countries endorse Open_Government_Declarations and publish national
OGP_action_plans with specific_open_government_reform_commitments.
The OGP agenda is broad and extends to disclosure of interests, public ethics,
anti-corruption, service delivery, budgetary efficiency, public safety and
corporate accountability. Further details are available on the OGP website,
www.opengovpartnership.org.
