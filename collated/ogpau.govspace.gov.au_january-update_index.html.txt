****** January update from the coordination team ******
Posted on January_29,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood
Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/

If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
