****** Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action Plan – Meeting
1 Update ******
Posted on September_6,_2016  by  ogpteam
Yesterday, the Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action Plan
met for the first time. Both government and civil society members were keen to
get down to the business of co-drafting Australia’s first National Action Plan.
The group talked about the need to develop an ambitious plan and had a
productive discussion about potential commitments that could be explored.
In addition to the commitments outlined in Agenda Item 4 (see: IWG_–_Meeting_1
–_Agenda_Item_4_–_Australia’s_National_Action_Plan), civil society
representatives also nominated access to information / FOI reform and a
national integrity system as areas for further discussion.
The final minutes from the meeting will be published this week, providing an
opportunity for the public to comment on the areas of potential focus for the
plan.

Group, please email ogp@pmc.gov.au.
