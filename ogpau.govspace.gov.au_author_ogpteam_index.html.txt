**UPDATE 8/11/2016:**

Following stakeholder feedback, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet is extending the deadline for public submissions on Australia’s
first Open Government National Action Plan to **5pm AEDT on Friday 18
November 2016.**

The Government will consider changes in response to public comments
before submitting the Plan to the Open Government Partnership before the
end of 2016.

We look forward to hearing your views.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever
Open Government National Action Plan for public consultation.

This is the final round of consultation in a year-long process to
develop the National Action Plan.

The draft Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:

-   PDF: [Australia’s first Open Government National Action
    Plan](../../files/2016/10/Australias-first-Open-Government-National-Action-Plan-Draft-for-consultation-Accessible.pdf)
-   DOCX: [Australia’s first Open Government National Action
    Plan](../../files/2016/10/Australias-first-Open-Government-National-Action-Plan-Draft-for-consultation-Plain-Text.docx)
-   HTML: [Australia’s first Open Government National Action
    Plan](../../draft-national-action-plan/index.html)

A fact sheet on consultation and the Plan can be accessed/downloaded
here:

-   PDF: [Consultation Fact
    Sheet](../../files/2016/10/NAP-fact-sheet-Accessible-extended.pdf)
-   DOCX: [Consultation Fact
    Sheet](../../files/2016/10/NAP-fact-sheet-Plain-Text-extended.docx)

The draft Plan sets out an ambitious agenda for the next two years,
focused on:

-   transparency and accountability in business
-   open data and digital transformation
-   access to government information
-   integrity in the public sector
-   public participation and engagement

The creation of a National Action Plan is part of the commitment the
Australian Government made when it became a member of the [Open
Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/).

Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft
Plan through a variety of consultation activities which started in
November 2015. An [Interim Working
Group](../../announcing-the-members-of-the-interim-working-group-for-australias-ogp-national-action-plan/index.html)
of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders was also
established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the
commitments.

The Open Government Partnership sets deadlines for submitting National
Action Plans. The Government will consider public comments and potential
changes to the Plan, before submitting it to the Open Government
Partnership before the end of 2016.

*How to provide feedback*

Public submissions close at **5pm AEDT on 18 November 2016**, and can be
made by emailing <ogp@pmc.gov.au> or by sending a hard copy to: Public
Data Branch, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, PO Box 6500,
Canberra, ACT, 2600.

Please indicate when you lodge your submission if you do not wish for it
to be published online. Submissions can be accessed/downloaded here:
[Public Consultation
page](../../contribute/public-consultation/index.html)

The focus of this round of consultation is on the details of the
proposed commitments in the Plan (e.g. Are there potential
implementation issues? Is the level of ambition appropriate?)
Consultation was undertaken earlier in 2016 to seek ideas on potential
commitments for the Plan.

Public information sessions are also being hosted jointly by government
and civil society representatives at selected locations around the
country. Please RSVP 24 hours before by emailing <ogp@pmc.gov.au>.

Ahead of the upcoming final stage of consultation on Australia’s first
Open Government National Action Plan, PM&C is releasing engage2’s report
on the public consultation undertaken between November 2015 and April
2016.

[engage2](http://www.engage2.com.au/) (a professional stakeholder
engagement consultancy) was engaged by PM&C to help design and lead a
public consultation process up until April 2016. The process is
summarised in the [OGPAU Engagement
Report](../../files/2016/10/Engagement-report-OGPAU_FINAL.pdf),  which
also outlines the outputs of the process, engage2’s lessons learned and
recommendations to PM&C.

PM&C would like to thank Amelia Loye and the engage2 team for their
efforts and hard work.

The upcoming public consultation period on the full draft of the
National Action Plan is the final stage in this year-long consultation
process to develop Australia’s first Open Government National Action
Plan. Stay tuned to this blog for more details.

On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at
the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in
Sydney.

The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon.
Angus Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil
society members about their priorities for the open government agenda.
Assistant Minister Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open
Government Partnership operate as a catalyst for action in his areas of
responsibility, including the open data agenda and digital
transformation of government.

In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on
the draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members
agreed to work together during this period to raise awareness about the
Open Government Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse
range of stakeholders on the draft Plan.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has [written to the
Open Government
Partnership](../../files/2016/10/Letter-from-Steven-Kennedy-to-OGP-CEO-14-Oct-2016-SIGNED.pdf) to
confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s first National Action
Plan.

The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow
adequate time for consultation within government and with the Australian
public. The timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that
has been put into developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group
of senior public servants and civil society stakeholders.

Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two
weeks. The Government will consider public comments before submitting
the Plan to the Open Government Partnership before the end of 2016.

Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or

Yesterday, the Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action
Plan met for the first time. Both government and civil society members
were keen to get down to the business of co-drafting Australia’s first
National Action Plan.

The group talked about the need to develop an ambitious plan and had a
productive discussion about potential commitments that could be
explored.

In addition to the commitments outlined in Agenda Item 4 (see: [IWG –
Meeting 1 – Agenda Item 4 – Australia’s National Action
Plan](../../files/2016/09/IWG-Meeting-1-Agenda-Item-4-Australias-National-Action-Plan.docx)),
civil society representatives also nominated access to information / FOI
reform and a national integrity system as areas for further discussion.

The final minutes from the meeting will be published this week,
providing an opportunity for the public to comment on the areas of
potential focus for the plan.

If you have any comments or suggestions on the work of the Interim
Working Group, please email <ogp@pmc.gov.au>.
