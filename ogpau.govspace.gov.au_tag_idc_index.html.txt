On Tuesday 5 April, the Government convened a second interdepartmental
committee (IDC) meeting on the Open Government Partnership. The meeting covered
the public submissions received to date, discussed attendance at the public
workshop to be held on Monday 11 April, and talked more broadly about the Open
Government Partnership process going forward, and how agencies will be
involved.
In attendance were:
    * Attorney-General’s Department
    * Australian Bureau of Statistics
    * Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
    * Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
    * Australian Public Service Commission
    * Department of Education and Training
    * Department of Employment
    * Department of Finance
    * Department of Health
    * Department of Human Services
    * Department of Immigration and Border Protection
    * Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
    * Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
    * Department of the Environment
    * Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
    * Digital Transformation Office
    * National Archives of Australia
    * Office of the Australian Information Commissioner
Also discussed at the meeting were a range of potential commitments that the
Agencies have come up with either in response to submissions received, or from
their own research and analysis.
The outlines of these are below, and they will be open for discussion at the
public workshop.
    * Centralised Annual Report discovery portal
    * Create a Digital Marketplace
    * Create, manage and preserve information digitally
    * Enable and encourage more data-driven digital report publishing
    * Future-proofing open data infrastructure
    * Grants.gov.au redevelopment
    * ICT Project dashboard
    * Redesign the open data request process
    * Scoping a public consultation platform
    * Scoping an e-Tabling system
    * Transforming high volume services
In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the
commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki and
other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy to read, in
line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is available for download
at National_Action_Plan_DRAFT_v5_–_For_Release
We have also posted the text onto the wiki at http://ogpau.wikispaces.com/
Draft+text+of+the+National+Action+Plan+-+5+April+2016 for your comments and
feedback prior to the meeting on Monday.
