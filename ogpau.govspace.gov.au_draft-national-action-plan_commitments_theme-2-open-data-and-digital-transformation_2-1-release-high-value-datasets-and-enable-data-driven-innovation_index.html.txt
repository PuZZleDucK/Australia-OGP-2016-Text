2.1 – Release high-value datasets and enable data driven innovation {#release-high-value-datasets-and-enable-data-driven-innovation .entry-title}
===================================================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to
release high-value public datasets and drive social and economic
outcomes.*

**Objective\
**Australia will continue to make more public data openly available and
support its use to launch commercial and non-profit ventures, conduct
research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.

**Status Quo\
**Public data is a valuable national resource and its use and reuse can
help grow the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy
outcomes.

While significant progress has been made to advance the public data
agenda within Australia, further work needs to be done to harness the
full value of this resource. Ongoing engagement is required to identify
the characteristics of high-value datasets and discover barriers to
accessing and sharing data.

The public, research, not-for-profit and private sectors can innovate
with this data in order to generate new business, develop new products
and services, and create social value.

The Government has provided some support to date, including through the
Open Data 500 Australia  and the DataStart initiative.  There is now the
opportunity to build and expand on these pilot initiatives to encourage
the use of public data for social and economic outcomes.

In the Government’s policy for Better and More Accessible Digital
Services, the Government committed to working with research,
not-for-profit and private sectors to identify high-value public
datasets for release. This will be supported by a public registry of
significant non sensitive datasets yet to be published on data.gov.au.
The Government is also establishing a \$50 million Smart Cities and
Suburbs Program to incentivise local councils to open up their data and
collaborate with communities, local business, not-for-profits and
research institutes to create innovative solutions to urban problems.

The Productivity Commission is undertaking an inquiry into data
availability and use that will also identify the characteristics (and
provide examples) of public datasets that would provide high value to
the public, research and private sectors, as well as the community.

**Ambition\
**To develop an open dialogue between government and non-government
sectors to identify high-value datasets and to stimulate greater use and
re‑use of public data in innovative ways.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **access to
information**, **technology and innovation** and **public
participation** by:

-   identifying and prioritising high-value datasets for priority
    release;
-   understanding how Australian businesses and not-for-profits are
    using public data;
-   stimulating use and re-use of public data in innovative ways;
-   encouraging the use of public data to create social value;
-   identifying, facilitating and addressing barriers impeding the
    sharing of and access to data; and
-   fostering a dialogue on how public data can be made more useful.
