5.2 – Enhance public participation in government decision making {#enhance-public-participation-in-government-decision-making .entry-title}
================================================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will work together to improve public participation in government
decision making for better policy development and service delivery
outcomes.*

**Objective\
**Australia will work towards improving public participation and
engagement to enhance policy and service delivery outcomes for
Australians.

**Status Quo\
**Government is comprised of a diverse range of organisations, with
approaches to participation varying considerably across different
departments and agencies. High barriers to participation and piecemeal
or unpredictable approaches to consultation can lead to an inefficient
and dissatisfying experience. The current mechanisms for consultation,
which are adapted from other online processes, often do not fully meet
the Government’s practical requirements for policy and program
development.  In addition, current mechanisms can be ineffective in
enabling ‘co-design’.

Numerous reviews have highlighted scope for improvement in the way the
Australian Public Service engages with the public when developing
policies and programs. For example, Peter Shergold’s Learning from
Failure recommended that “the APS should promote new forms of civil
participation, including digital and deliberative democracy techniques,
in order to enhance consumer-directed care, improve customer service,
encourage greater public engagement and inform the public economy”.

There is a need to identify and disseminate information on good
practices and help peer exchange between government agencies and across
different levels of government. Digital technologies also open up new
opportunities for engagement and there are a range of innovative
techniques that could be further explored at the Commonwealth level
(e.g. policy hacks, online challenge platforms and citizen juries). In
addition, there has been a lack of investment in social media and
on-line tools relevant to public participation in government
decision-making.

The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 also
requires Commonwealth entities to work cooperatively with others to
achieve common objectives, where practicable.

**Ambition\
**To design and adopt a whole-of-government framework that embeds
meaningful, open, public and multi-stakeholder participation into the
business of policy development and service delivery.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **transparency**,
**accountability** and **public** **participation** by:

-   -   facilitating informed public participation;
    -   improving policy development and service delivery;
    -   enhancing transparency around government decision making;
    -   encouraging an ongoing sharing of information and views across
        interest groups that builds consensus on broad policy
        directions; and
    -   creating more engaged private and community sectors, and public.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   Improving Public Services

**Timeframes\
**Late 2016 – July 2018

**Lead agency\
**Department of Industry, Innovation and Science

**Other actors involved**\
*Government:* All Commonwealth entities

*Non-government:* Research, not-for-profit and private sectors

**Milestones**

1.  Undertake and publicly release a stocktake of current approaches to
    public participation to determine best practice activities
    (including international and domestic examples, user experience
    research and relevant standards, such as IAP2).
    -   Late 2016 –  Early 2017

2.  Work with government agencies, the public and organisations outside
    of government to develop and implement a whole-of-government
    framework (with guidance / principles and potential initiatives) for
    improving public participation and engagement across
    the Commonwealth.
    -   Early – Mid 2017

3.  Undertake pilot public participation initiatives, including working
    with the Digital Transformation Agency to more effectively use
    digital channels for engagement.
    -   Mid 2017 – July 2018

4.  Review processes and iterate as necessary.
    -   Ongoing
