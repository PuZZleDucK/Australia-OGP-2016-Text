OGP National Action Plan
1
Guidance Note
This note was developed by the Open Government Partnership Support Unit to provide guidance to participating
countries on how to draft a National Action Plan in accordance with the Articles of Governance and international best
practices. For more information, email the Support Unit at info@opengovpartnership.org
National Action Plans are at the core of a country’s participation in OGP. They are the product of a co-creation process
in which government and civil society define ambitious commitments to foster transparency, accountability and public
participation. This guidance note reflects lessons learned from the first three years of OGP on producing high quality
action plans. In addition, the note includes templates that will ensure all the necessary information on commitments and
the development process is included in the action plan.
Main Action Plan Characteristics
Successful OGP action plans focus on ambitious national open government priorities; are relevant to the values of
transparency, accountability and public participation; and contain specific, time-bound and measureable commitments.
Ambitious: OGP aims to promote ambitious open government reforms that stretch the government beyond its current
state of practice, significantly improving the status quo by strengthening transparency, accountability and public
participation in government. Countries may choose to initiate new open government initiatives in their action plans, or
improve on existing, ongoing reforms. Countries are encouraged to show clear improvement from action plan to action
plan.
Relevant: Countries should ensure that each commitment included in the action plan is clearly advancing one or more
of the following open government principles:
• Transparency: This includes publication of all government-held information (as opposed to only information
on government activities); proactive or reactive releases of information; mechanisms to strengthen the right to
information; and open access to government information.
• Accountability: There are rules, regulations and mechanisms in place that call upon government actors to justify
their actions, act upon criticisms or requirements made of them, and accept responsibility for failure to perform with
respect to laws or commitments. Commitments on accountability should typically include an answerability element,
i.e. that they are not purely internal systems of accountability but involve the public.
• Participation: Governments seek to mobilize citizens to engage in a dialogue on government policies or
programs, provide input or feedback, and make contributions that lead to more responsive, innovative and effective
governance.
• Technology and Innovation: Governments embrace the importance of providing citizens with open access to
technology, the role of new technologies in driving innovation, and the importance of increasing the capacity of
citizens to use technology. E-government initiatives are welcome, but in order to be relevant to OGP, action plans
should explain how these initiatives advance government transparency, accountability and/or public participation
1 Article of Governance VI. OGP ACTION PLANS AND REPORTING. Action plans should be for a duration of two years, though individual commitments contained in
these action plans may be for more or less than two years depending on the nature of the commitment. However, each action plan should include one-year and two-year
benchmarks, so that governments, civil society organizations, and the Independent Reporting Mechanism (see below), have a common set of time-bound metrics to assess
progress. As living documents, action plans may be updated as needed based on ongoing consultations with civil society. Any updates should be duly noted in the official
version of the action plan on the OGP website.
For more information contact info@opengovpartnership.orgF R O M C O M M I T M E N T TO AC T I O N
SMART: Individual commitments should conform to the following:
• Specific: The commitment precisely describes the problem it is trying to solve, the activities it comprises and the
expected outcomes.
• Measurable: It is possible to verify the fulfillment of the commitment. Where commitments have multiple sub-
commitments, they are broken into clear, measurable milestones.
• Answerable: The commitment clearly specifies the main implementing agency, the coordinating or supporting
agencies where relevant, and if necessary, other civil society, multilateral, or private sector partners who have a role in
implementing the commitment.
• Relevant: For each commitment, the action plan should explain its relevance to one or more of the open
government principles outlined above (transparency, accountability, public participation and technology &
innovation).
• Time-bound: Commitment clearly states the date when it will be completed, as well as dates for milestones,
benchmarks and any other deadline.
Action Plan Template 2
<<Country name>>
National Action Plan
201X-201X
1. Introduction
Briefly explain the local context by discussing why open government efforts are important for the country. This
section should also outline the governance reform priorities for the country and identify the grand challenges that
the country intends to address through its OGP National Action Plan along with a justification.
2. Open Government Efforts to Date
Provide a brief narrative of key open government initiatives and accomplishments to date, particularly as they
relate to the government’s chosen grand challenges. This section should explain how the new action plan builds on
previous OGP action plans and related efforts to strengthen open government reforms.
3. NAP Development Process
OGP participants commit to “co-create” their country action plans through a multi-stakeholder consultation process,
with the active engagement of citizens and civil society. In this section please describe the NAP development
process, including the consultation.
Please consider that regarding the consultation process, the IRM evaluates the following activities:
1. Availability of timeline: Countries are to make the details of their public consultation process and timeline available
(online at minimum) prior to the consultation.
2. Adequate notice: Countries are to consult the population with sufficient forewarning. Many countries have
chosen to share written drafts two weeks before the official start of consultation to allow stakeholders to organize
themselves.
3. Awareness raising: Countries are to undertake OGP awareness raising activities to enhance public participation in
2 This section includes the main components of an action plan. Each country can modify the format and add any sections they desire. However we strongly suggest to at
least include the information in this template.

the consultation.
4. Multiple channels: Countries are to consult through a variety of mechanisms—including online and through in-
person meetings—to ensure the accessibility of opportunities for citizens to engage.
5. Breadth of consultation: Countries are to consult widely with the national community, including civil society and
the private sector, and to seek out a diverse range of views.
6. Documentation and feedback: Countries are to make a summary of the public consultation and all individual
written comment submissions available online.
7. Consultation during implementation: Countries are to identify a forum to enable regular multi-stakeholder
consultation on OGP implementation—this can be an existing entity or a new one.
4. Commitments
Each commitment as written must be specific, clear, and succinct. Each commitment should be no more than
a few paragraphs or half a page in length. The level of ambition and relevance to OGP values should be clearly
demonstrated. Experience has shown that action plans listing 5-15 high quality commitments are preferable to those
with very large numbers of weaker commitments.
Use the following template for each commitment in your action plan.

Format and length
• Action plans should be clear, succinct, and action-oriented, approximately 8-12 pages in length and written in plain
language with minimal use of jargon or technical terms.
• Governments are encouraged to work with multiple ministries and departments across the government to develop
and implement their OGP commitments. For ease of communication, the contact information for the lead agency of
each commitment should be included in the action plan.
• We strongly recommend that each action plan contain between 5 and 15 ambitious commitments. Where multiple
commitments address the same policy issue, they should be grouped as individual milestones under a single
commitment.
• The expected length of each commitment is approximately half a page. A few paragraphs that clearly state the
specific action or reform the government is going to undertake should suffice.
• All actions plans must cover a two-year period. At minimum one-year and two-year milestones for each commitment
are required so that governments, civil society organizations, and the Independent Reporting Mechanism, have a
common set of time-bound metrics to assess progress.
• Commitments that will take longer than two years to implement are welcome as long as they are clearly marked in the
country’s next action plan.
• While action plans can be written in the country’s official language, governments are required to submit an English
translation to the OGP Support Unit.

Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

****** Results_of_the_co-creation_workshop_and_ongoing_engagement ******
Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.
See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan on_this_wiki.
Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.

Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government
have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the wiki.
This marks the end of Stage_2_of_our_engagement_process, which was designed to
raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31st March.
We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations.
The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.

****** OGPAU_theme_teleconference_times ******
Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the
wiki.Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.
Save the date! Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-
create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on
the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to
lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action
with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for
us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.
Need help? This how_to_Suggest_an_Action_document_provides_some_tips. It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.
In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on
the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:
    * Engagement_for_OGP
    * Fiscal_Transparency
    * Fostering_Innovation
    * Freedom_of_Information
    * Government_Integrity
    * Open_Data
    * Public_Participation
    * Public_Service_Delivery
    * Resources_Management
We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each
action suggested.
Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these themes
with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have
also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to
get involved. PM&C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the
11th April workshop.
***** Some questions that emerged during engagement last week *****
    * After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the
      process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?
    * How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of
      the Grand Challenges?
    * What happened to the proposed teleconference?
    * How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?
Responses to your questions
Cocreation – The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting
actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team,
but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra
will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come
together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can
only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host
theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP commitment_templates with you.
Grand challenges – The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges
are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of
these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions
suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will
share more about Government’s position on this soon.
Teleconference –I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to
invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others
who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities,
differences and priorities before the 11th April event.
Working together to prioritise actions – We need to work together to prioritise
suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to
help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop
on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:
    * Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
      discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they
      might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.
    * In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you who
      have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or
      30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we
      can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.
***** Actions that you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Encouraging theme based engagement– I will be running teleconferences
      with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have
      suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about
      this.
    * Encouraging feedback from others on actions –actions have now been themed
      into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are
      looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and
      opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise
      with you at the workshop.

    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Networks.
Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will
include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might
be more involved.

****** Engagement_update_–_11_March ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of
      the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others
      you like.
    * Researching OGP NAP review reports to understand how Australia might be
      assessed and what actions should include.
Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss
your ideas and ways you might be more involved.

****** What_I’m_learning_about_Open_Gov_in_Australia ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available
                  to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the
                  OEH website.
                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
                  methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
                  that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
                  through social media.
                # Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
                  drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in
                  OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify
                  and train key staff who can help determine barriers and
                  enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider.
                  Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve
                  responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and
                  speed up approval for the release of open data.
                # Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
                  resource management programs such as the coastal reforms
                  project.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.
Amelia Loye

Stage_2 ******
Posted on December_22,_2015  by  Helen_Owens

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

UPDATE 8/11/2016:
Following stakeholder feedback, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet is extending the deadline for public submissions on Australia’s first
Open Government National Action Plan to 5pm AEDT on Friday 18 November 2016.
The Government will consider changes in response to public comments before
submitting the Plan to the Open Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
We look forward to hearing your views.
===============================================================================
The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever Open
Government National Action Plan for public consultation.
This is the final round of consultation in a year-long process to develop the
National Action Plan.
The draft Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * DOCX: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * HTML: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
A fact sheet on consultation and the Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
    * DOCX: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
The draft Plan sets out an ambitious agenda for the next two years, focused on:
    * transparency and accountability in business
    * open data and digital transformation
    * access to government information
    * integrity in the public sector
    * public participation and engagement
The creation of a National Action Plan is part of the commitment the Australian
Government made when it became a member of the Open_Government_Partnership.
Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft Plan
through a variety of consultation activities which started in November 2015. An
Interim_Working_Group of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders
was also established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the
commitments.
The Open Government Partnership sets deadlines for submitting National Action
Plans. The Government will consider public comments and potential changes to
the Plan, before submitting it to the Open Government Partnership before the
end of 2016.
How_to_provide_feedback
Public submissions close at 5pm AEDT on 18 November 2016, and can be made by
emailing ogp@pmc.gov.au or by sending a hard copy to: Public Data Branch,
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, PO Box 6500, Canberra, ACT, 2600.
Please indicate when you lodge your submission if you do not wish for it to be
published online. Submissions can be accessed/downloaded here: Public
Consultation_page
The focus of this round of consultation is on the details of the proposed
commitments in the Plan (e.g. Are there potential implementation issues? Is the
level of ambition appropriate?) Consultation was undertaken earlier in 2016 to
seek ideas on potential commitments for the Plan.
Public information sessions are also being hosted jointly by government and
civil society representatives at selected locations around the country. Please
RSVP 24 hours before by emailing ogp@pmc.gov.au.

Ahead of the upcoming final stage of consultation on Australia’s first Open
Government National Action Plan, PM&C is releasing engage2’s report on the
public consultation undertaken between November 2015 and April 2016.
engage2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by PM&C
to help design and lead a public consultation process up until April 2016. The
process is summarised in the OGPAU_Engagement_Report,  which also outlines the
outputs of the process, engage2’s lessons learned and recommendations to PM&C.
PM&C would like to thank Amelia Loye and the engage2 team for their efforts and
hard work.
The upcoming public consultation period on the full draft of the National
Action Plan is the final stage in this year-long consultation process to
develop Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan. Stay tuned to

On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in Sydney.
The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus
Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil society members
about their priorities for the open government agenda. Assistant Minister
Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate
as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open
data agenda and digital transformation of government.
In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on the
draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members agreed to work
together during this period to raise awareness about the Open Government
Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse range of stakeholders on
the draft Plan.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has written_to_the_Open
Government_Partnership to confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s
first National Action Plan.
The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow adequate time
for consultation within government and with the Australian public. The
timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that has been put into
developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group of senior public servants
and civil society stakeholders.
Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two weeks. The
Government will consider public comments before submitting the Plan to the Open
Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or sign_up

Yesterday, the Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action Plan
met for the first time. Both government and civil society members were keen to
get down to the business of co-drafting Australia’s first National Action Plan.
The group talked about the need to develop an ambitious plan and had a
productive discussion about potential commitments that could be explored.
In addition to the commitments outlined in Agenda Item 4 (see: IWG_–_Meeting_1
–_Agenda_Item_4_–_Australia’s_National_Action_Plan), civil society
representatives also nominated access to information / FOI reform and a
national integrity system as areas for further discussion.
The final minutes from the meeting will be published this week, providing an
opportunity for the public to comment on the areas of potential focus for the
plan.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce the
members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the collaborative
spirit of the OGP.
The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely competitive
field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public engagement with Australia’s

of fields relevant to open government, and represent a diverse range of
interests and sectors.
Meet the civil society representatives:

      Council of Australia and has also previously served as the President of
      the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the Victorian Bar, and as a
      member of the Law Council Executive Board. Fiona brings considerable
      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience
      working with government, corporate and non-government sectors. The Law
      Council engages closely in parliamentary and public sector reform
      processes related to transparency and strengthening the integrity of
      public offices.
    * The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Ken is an Associate Professor at Monash

      Australia, Transparency International Australia and as a member of the
      Secretariat for the Tax Justice Network in Australia.
    * Ms Maree Adshead: Maree is the CEO of the Open Data Institute Queensland,
      a node of the international Open Data Institute. She has held a number of
      industry representative roles, including as past Chair of the Technology

      Chair of the Australian Information Industry Association Queensland. ODI
      Queensland promotes the release of public data to increase
      accountability, improve efficiencies, and to drive technological
      innovation.
    * Mr Peter Timmins: Peter is the Interim Convener of the OGP Civil Society
      Network, a coalition of civil society organisations and individuals
      committed to making government work better through transparency,

Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

Stakeholder expressions of interest to join the Interim Working Group for
Australia’s National Action Plan have now closed, with approximately 40
submissions received.
We are extremely pleased with the quality of the submissions, the diversity of
applicants and the extensive experience they offer.
The large number of submissions reflects the ongoing interest and public
engagement with Australia’s process to join the Open Government Partnership.
Regardless of who is selected for the Interim Working Group, we look forward to
continuing to work with all interested parties as we co-draft Australia’s first
National Action Plan.
We are endeavouring to notify applicants of the outcome of their submission
over the coming days. PM&C is also engaging with key agencies to finalise the
government members of the Interim Working Group.
As always, any enquiries can be submitted to this blog or to OGP@pmc.gov.au.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.

***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****
Please add your comments to the draft Background_page for any additional
efforts to date.

****** Submission_from_the_Australian_Open_Government_Network_(AOGPN) ******
Posted on February_3,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood

This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open
Government Network on February 2 2016.
===============================================================================
 
Australian Open Government network
I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and
organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of
Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and
participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on
areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true
spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of
priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
    * Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
    * Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
    * Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
    * Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash
      University)
    * Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
    * Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
    * Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
    * Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the
process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil
Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more
comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to
contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.
The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the
government moves ahead on this important initiative.
Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how
government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of
Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.
While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic
and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage
participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members
of the public.
While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information
sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and
entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be
substantial national engagement activity.
The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the
OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been
no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his
Cabinet Ministers.
While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs
announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily
available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime
Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation
website.
As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to
public attention.
Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.
The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice
were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national
campaign of engagement.
Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in
recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials
published online. However these materials are not readily available to
interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.
In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a
challenge even for those aware of the process.
While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there
is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely
taking place.
It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at
risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of
Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of
insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.
General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced
it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include
Public Integrity.
Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of
consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing
to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have
been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.
The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the
necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP
initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the
lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society
together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision
making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself
with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs
provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that
Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and
timeline.
The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil
society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for
the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.
The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states,
territories and local government must be part of the open government journey.
The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open
government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian
Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a
discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.
The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future
of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that
should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal
of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.
The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s
proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent
government.”
As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan,
wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go
through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”
Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background
material.
At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of
the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN
General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti
corruption matters.
The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight
governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.
Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan
required by the convention.
The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/
Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership
role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.
The Plan states:
     “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our
     government agencies, policies, and officials implement international
     best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The
     (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement,
     open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public
     officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public
     officials as issues which merit particular attention.”
The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:
     “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
     committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
     corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-
     Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on
     Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our
     companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption.
     Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is
     essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open
     Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in
     Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset
     disclosure frameworks…”
The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level
Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for
Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data
Principles.
Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the
consultation proceeds.
Please publish this submission on the Open Government Partnership Australia
website.

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
ogpau.wikispaces.com .

****** OGP_Update_–_3_August ******
Posted on August_3,_2016  by  ogpteam

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

****** Results_of_the_co-creation_workshop_and_ongoing_engagement ******
Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.
See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan on_this_wiki.
Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.

Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government
have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the wiki.
This marks the end of Stage_2_of_our_engagement_process, which was designed to
raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31st March.
We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations.
The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.

****** OGPAU_theme_teleconference_times ******
Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of
      the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others
      you like.
    * Researching OGP NAP review reports to understand how Australia might be
      assessed and what actions should include.
Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss
your ideas and ways you might be more involved.

****** What_I’m_learning_about_Open_Gov_in_Australia ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available
                  to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the
                  OEH website.
                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
                  methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
                  that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
                  through social media.
                # Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
                  drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in
                  OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify
                  and train key staff who can help determine barriers and
                  enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider.
                  Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve
                  responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and
                  speed up approval for the release of open data.
                # Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
                  resource management programs such as the coastal reforms
                  project.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.

The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://
      ogpau.wikispaces.com/
    * A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air
      ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to
      the consultation. Please subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list to indicate
      your interest in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to
      present their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where
      and when this forum will take place will be published on this website
      closer to the date.
    * You can add comments to this Stage 2 Blog post (below).

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.

***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****
Please add your comments to the draft Background_page for any additional
efforts to date.

This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open
Government Network on February 2 2016.
===============================================================================
 
Australian Open Government network
I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and
organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of
Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and
participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on
areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true
spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of
priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
    * Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
    * Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
    * Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
    * Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash
      University)
    * Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
    * Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
    * Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
    * Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the
process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil
Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more
comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to
contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.
The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the
government moves ahead on this important initiative.
Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how
government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of
Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.
While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic
and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage
participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members
of the public.
While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information
sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and
entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be
substantial national engagement activity.
The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the
OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been
no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his
Cabinet Ministers.
While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs
announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily
available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime
Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation
website.
As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to
public attention.
Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.
The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice
were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national
campaign of engagement.
Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in
recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials
published online. However these materials are not readily available to
interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.
In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a
challenge even for those aware of the process.
While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there
is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely
taking place.
It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at
risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of
Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of
insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.
General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced
it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include
Public Integrity.
Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of
consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing
to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have
been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.
The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the
necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP
initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the
lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society
together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision
making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself
with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs
provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that
Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and
timeline.
The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil
society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for
the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.
The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states,
territories and local government must be part of the open government journey.
The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open
government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian
Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a
discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.
The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future
of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that
should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal
of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.
The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s
proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent
government.”
As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan,
wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go
through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”
Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background
material.
At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of
the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN
General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti
corruption matters.
The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight
governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.
Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan
required by the convention.
The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/
Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership
role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.
The Plan states:
     “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our
     government agencies, policies, and officials implement international
     best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The
     (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement,
     open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public
     officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public
     officials as issues which merit particular attention.”
The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:
     “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
     committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
     corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-
     Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on
     Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our
     companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption.
     Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is
     essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open
     Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in
     Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset
     disclosure frameworks…”
The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level
Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for
Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data
Principles.
Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the
consultation proceeds.
Please publish this submission on the Open Government Partnership Australia
website.

UPDATE 8/11/2016:
Following stakeholder feedback, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet is extending the deadline for public submissions on Australia’s first
Open Government National Action Plan to 5pm AEDT on Friday 18 November 2016.
The Government will consider changes in response to public comments before
submitting the Plan to the Open Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
We look forward to hearing your views.
===============================================================================
The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever Open
Government National Action Plan for public consultation.
This is the final round of consultation in a year-long process to develop the
National Action Plan.
The draft Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * DOCX: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * HTML: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
A fact sheet on consultation and the Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
    * DOCX: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
The draft Plan sets out an ambitious agenda for the next two years, focused on:
    * transparency and accountability in business
    * open data and digital transformation
    * access to government information
    * integrity in the public sector
    * public participation and engagement
The creation of a National Action Plan is part of the commitment the Australian
Government made when it became a member of the Open_Government_Partnership.
Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft Plan
through a variety of consultation activities which started in November 2015. An
Interim_Working_Group of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders
was also established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the
commitments.
The Open Government Partnership sets deadlines for submitting National Action
Plans. The Government will consider public comments and potential changes to
the Plan, before submitting it to the Open Government Partnership before the
end of 2016.
How_to_provide_feedback
Public submissions close at 5pm AEDT on 18 November 2016, and can be made by
emailing ogp@pmc.gov.au or by sending a hard copy to: Public Data Branch,
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, PO Box 6500, Canberra, ACT, 2600.
Please indicate when you lodge your submission if you do not wish for it to be
published online. Submissions can be accessed/downloaded here: Public
Consultation_page
The focus of this round of consultation is on the details of the proposed
commitments in the Plan (e.g. Are there potential implementation issues? Is the
level of ambition appropriate?) Consultation was undertaken earlier in 2016 to
seek ideas on potential commitments for the Plan.

On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in Sydney.
The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus
Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil society members
about their priorities for the open government agenda. Assistant Minister
Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate
as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open
data agenda and digital transformation of government.
In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on the
draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members agreed to work
together during this period to raise awareness about the Open Government
Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse range of stakeholders on
the draft Plan.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has written_to_the_Open
Government_Partnership to confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s
first National Action Plan.
The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow adequate time
for consultation within government and with the Australian public. The
timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that has been put into
developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group of senior public servants
and civil society stakeholders.
Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two weeks. The
Government will consider public comments before submitting the Plan to the Open
Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or sign_up

Yesterday, the Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action Plan
met for the first time. Both government and civil society members were keen to
get down to the business of co-drafting Australia’s first National Action Plan.
The group talked about the need to develop an ambitious plan and had a
productive discussion about potential commitments that could be explored.
In addition to the commitments outlined in Agenda Item 4 (see: IWG_–_Meeting_1
–_Agenda_Item_4_–_Australia’s_National_Action_Plan), civil society
representatives also nominated access to information / FOI reform and a
national integrity system as areas for further discussion.

plan.

      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience

with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

Stakeholder expressions of interest to join the Interim Working Group for
Australia’s National Action Plan have now closed, with approximately 40
submissions received.
We are extremely pleased with the quality of the submissions, the diversity of
applicants and the extensive experience they offer.
The large number of submissions reflects the ongoing interest and public
engagement with Australia’s process to join the Open Government Partnership.
Regardless of who is selected for the Interim Working Group, we look forward to
continuing to work with all interested parties as we co-draft Australia’s first
National Action Plan.
We are endeavouring to notify applicants of the outcome of their submission
over the coming days. PM&C is also engaging with key agencies to finalise the
government members of the Interim Working Group.
As always, any enquiries can be submitted to this blog or to OGP@pmc.gov.au.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the
wiki.Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.
Save the date! Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-
create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on
the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to
lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action
with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for
us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.
Need help? This how_to_Suggest_an_Action_document_provides_some_tips. It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.
In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on
the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:
    * Engagement_for_OGP
    * Fiscal_Transparency
    * Fostering_Innovation
    * Freedom_of_Information
    * Government_Integrity
    * Open_Data
    * Public_Participation
    * Public_Service_Delivery
    * Resources_Management
We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each
action suggested.
Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these themes
with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have
also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to
get involved. PM&C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the
11th April workshop.
***** Some questions that emerged during engagement last week *****
    * After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the
      process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?
    * How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of
      the Grand Challenges?
    * What happened to the proposed teleconference?
    * How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?
Responses to your questions
Cocreation – The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting
actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team,
but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra
will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come
together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can
only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host
theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP commitment_templates with you.
Grand challenges – The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges
are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of
these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions
suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will
share more about Government’s position on this soon.
Teleconference –I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to
invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others
who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities,
differences and priorities before the 11th April event.
Working together to prioritise actions – We need to work together to prioritise
suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to
help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop
on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:
    * Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
      discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they
      might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.
    * In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you who
      have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or
      30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we
      can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.
***** Actions that you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Encouraging theme based engagement– I will be running teleconferences
      with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have
      suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about
      this.
    * Encouraging feedback from others on actions –actions have now been themed
      into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are
      looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and
      opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise
      with you at the workshop.
    * Connecting Australians to theworking_groupsand Open Government
      Partnership Support Unit,Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
      shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Networks.
Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will
include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might
be more involved.

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
ogpau.wikispaces.com .

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.
The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:
Brisbane:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-brisbane-information-session.eventbrite.com

****** Consultation Stage 1: Preparation, Framework and History ******
Posted on November_17,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.

***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.

***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****
Please add your comments to the draft Background_page for any additional
efforts to date.

      National_Archives_of_Australia on January_8,_2016_at_9:07_am said:
      This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the
      National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives
      Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it
      has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is
      the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in
      government through its legislated role of setting records and information
      management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and
      preserving and providing a public right of access to government
      information.
      Open government increases the transparency and accountability of
      government, encourages greater public engagement, strengthens governance
      and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key
      role in open government by promoting the creation, management and
      preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information,
      and facilitating access to this information.
      The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and
      effectively covers all information created, used or received in the
      course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth)
      (Archives Act), the National Archives:
      • identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
      • preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth
      accessible;
      • oversees Commonwealth records management;
      • determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
      • imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.
      Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the
      transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of
      successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government
      policy. It is from this perspective and with this legislated role that
      the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on
      the Vision and the framework for the National Action Plan.
      Vision
      The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved
      management of, and accessibility to, information and records. A key
      element of this is a move to fully digital information management and
      business processes across the Australian government sector. This aligns
      with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the
      United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the
      example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st
      century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve
      transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a
      number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading
      including earlier access to government records, the Digital Continuity
      2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government
      information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.
      The National Archives also recommends that the Vision and Plan recognise
      Australia’s strong open government history, culture, initiatives and
      policies already in existence, including the Archives Act, to demonstrate
      Australia as a leading example of open government well before the Open
      Government Partnership came into being.
      The government also recognises through legislation such as the Archives
      Act 1983, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988
      the need to restrict the circulation of some information for a particular
      time in order to protect the defence and security of the nation, its
      relationship with the world, and the privacy of citizens. The Archives
      Act entrusts the National Archives with this role in relation to
      government information and provides for the exemption from public release
      of a number of categories of information including national security,
      defence, international relations, confidential information, and personal
      affairs. When sensitivities lapse, information that was formerly withheld
      can be made available for access. The balance between the need to protect
      information from unauthorised use or accidental release, and open
      government principles should be considered in development of the Vision.
      The Australian Government’s policy of open government is well
      established, and it is therefore well positioned to contribute to the
      Open Government Partnership and the National Action Plan. It will also be
      well positioned to target areas that require more effort to continue to
      advance open government in Australia. The National Archives has, and will
      continue to, play a key role in supporting open government initiatives by
      carrying out its core functions and by effectively contributing to
      Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership.
      Framework
      The National Archives supports the general framework outlined in the
      Australian Government National Action Plan template, and recommends a
      clear and strong statement of Open Government achievements to date from
      both a contemporary and historical context. We would particularly like to
      note Australia as one of the most open archival and government
      information access regimes in the world through the management,
      preservation and provision of access to government information under the
      Archives Act.
      Established by the Act, one of the National Archives’ key roles is
      enabling public access to the archival resources of the nation. Through
      this role, the Archives has played a lead in open government and ensuring
      that citizens have access to the decisions and actions of their
      government, thereby supporting the rights and entitlements of individuals
      and promoting accountability and transparency.

      I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
      membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational
      principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This
      is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those
      the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the
      design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.
      However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining
      membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in
      four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately
      disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil
      society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by
      this approach to ‘engagement’

      [Pia Waugh] The following comment was contributed via email from Tim
      Smith of the Accountability Round Table and is published here with
      permission, along with a link to the longer submission sent.
      [Tim Smith] I Chair the Accountability Round Table (http://
      www.accountabilityrt.org/). Its aims and objectives mirror those of the
      Open Government Partnership. It came into existence in 2006 and, since
      then, has been seeking to achieve those aims and objectives at the
      Commonwealth and State levels.
      The Government should be congratulated in recently confirming its
      commitment to the OGP and embarking upon the preparation of the National
      Action Plan. The Australian community has been provided with a unique and
      very significant opportunity to reform our Commonwealth Parliamentary
      democracy, and indirectly those of the States and Territories, by
      addressing, in partnership with the Government, the serious weaknesses
      and problems that have developed in our that Democracy. It has the
      potential to be the most important development in Australia’s Democracies
      since Federation. Whether that is realised will depend, in large measure,
      on the Australian Community’s response within this new Partnership.
      ART has made a submission to the Government addressing the matters raised
      in this first stage (Link to submission). In it, ART submits that it will
      be critical for the successful formulation of Australia’s NAP, that the
      Partnership, from the outset address the following.
      1. Identify what should guide this Partnership enterprise. This includes
      –
      • the Objectives of the OGP and its Mission Statement,
      • the nature and purposes of parliamentary democracies and
      • a fundamental but long forgotten ethical and common-law principle –
      that public office is a public trust and that those holding public office
      are under a fiduciary obligation when exercising their powers entrusted
      to them to place the public interest first and ahead of their own
      interests and other private interests.
      ART submits that all people who participate in this Partnership
      enterprise, should be guided by these matters and principles.
      We also submit that the absence of the public office public trust
      principle from our Australian consciousness for many years has been a
      major factor in the problems that now exist in our Commonwealth
      Democracy;
      2. Accurately and completely establish not only the past history of our
      Commonwealth democracy but also its current reality, good and bad. We
      submit that significantly more work is needed to complete this task — in
      respect of both the good and the bad.
      Applying the above objectives and principles to the actual realities,
      past and present, the Partnership can proceed with reasonable confidence
      in choosing, in the public interest, the
      • OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that should be selected and
      • the commitments that should be given priority in the NAP.
      The Partnership can also articulate its Vision and fine tune the proposed
      Framework for the development of the NAP.
      The Submission discusses these issues, the relevant evidence and the
      choices of the OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that will best serve
      the public interest in the Commonwealth of Australia.
      We hope that it will be found helpful in each stage of this historic
      exercise.

      TIA congratulates the Australian Government and Prime Minister Turnbull
      for the recent decision to commit to finalizing Australia’s membership of
      the OGP, and for the proactive approach it is taking to public
      consultation in the development of the first Australian Government
      National Action Plan.
      The OGP requires broad consultation in the development of the NAP – from
      the public, civil society and the private sector. TIA’s comments come
      from its perspective as the leading civil society organization promoting
      transparency, integrity and accountability, and fighting corruption.
      Introduction
      Now that it has decided to commit to finalizing its membership of the
      OGP, the government is moving with commendable speed to draft its first
      National Action Plan by May 2016, for government consideration in June
      2016, and a launch in July 2016. This speed does bring risks – that the
      first National Action Plan is essentially a ‘goodwill’ document, not
      ambitious enough and not containing commitments of substance. The second
      risk is that to meet these tight timelines the consultation process will
      be structured in a way which downplays the opportunity for real input
      from civil society and other non-government sectors. The Government and
      its advisers may take the view that it is better to have a first NAP,
      however imperfect, and that the NAP process and content will be much more
      satisfactory the second time around. TIA’s job, and that of civil society
      generally, is to participate as fully as possible in the development of a
      first NAP which is ambitious in scope and commitment, and flags priority
      areas for future NAPs. TIA is committed to membership of the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Network recently constituted
      The remainder of this short paper flags some initial comments and areas
      of interest to TIA.
      Increasing Public Integrity
      The OGP – Australia website has already indicated that the first National
      Action Plan will focus on two of the OGP’s five ‘grand challenges’:
      Improving Public Services, and More Effectively Managing Public
      Resources. This decision was made without public consultation on whether
      other ‘grand challenges’ should have greater priority, especially
      Increasing Public Integrity (‘measures that address corruption and public
      ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and
      civil society freedom’). Successive Australian Governments have made
      considerable and sustained progress in improving public services and more
      effectively managing public resources, whereas limited and patchy
      progress has been made in the areas of corruption and public ethics,
      access to information, and campaign finance reform. In other words, there
      is much more to do in relation to increasing public integrity. TIA
      recommends that the Government include Increasing Public Integrity as one
      of its initial ‘grand challenges’.
      Identification of specific measures in the Australian NAP
      Many of the potential transparency gains from the OGP are cross-cutting
      issues that affect integrity in other sectors, other nations and multiple
      levels of government. In several countries, including the UK, ‘open
      government’ has been used to identify and implement crucial transparency
      and accountability measures such as the establishment of registers of
      beneficial ownership of companies, lifting the veil on opaque shell
      companies that the corrupt use to hold and transfer their illicit gains,
      implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative or
      developing comprehensive national anti-corruption agencies or
      comprehensive national anti-corruption action plans.
      TIA recommends that the Australian Government demonstrate its full
      commitment to participation in the Open Government Partnership, by
      undertaking to use open government reforms to meet the challenge of
      increasing public integrity in its national action plan, as an important
      element in increasing transparency and lowering corruption in Australia –
      and in particular by implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency
      Initiative, ensuring greater transparency in public procurement, and
      committing to a public register of corporate beneficial owners.
      Right to Information
      In 2014 the Federal Government withdrew funding and introduced
      legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information
      Commissioner (OAIC) and to reassign its functions to other government
      agencies and departments. The legislation has failed to pass the
      Parliament, and is unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future, leaving
      the OAIC ‘in limbo’ and the national FOI, privacy and information policy
      regimes in jeopardy. Abolition of the OAIC and dispersal of its strategic
      and operational functions between existing agencies and departments risks
      fragmentation of access to information rights and tools, which have
      historically been crucial in preventing and exposing corruption.
      TIA recommends that as part of its development of the draft National
      Action Plan the Australian Government should renew its full support for a
      strong access to information regime by withdrawing legislation to abolish
      the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, re-instating
      funding for the OAIC to fulfill its mandate in relation to freedom of
      information, privacy, and information policy, and ensuring the prompt
      appointment of a new Australian Information Commissioner with full
      powers, located in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
      Multi-stakeholder oversight group
      Experience in developing OGP National Action Plans elsewhere suggests an
      advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance and add value to the
      partnership. The role of civil society in Australia’s OGP is critical,
      not just to ensure Australia’s OGP membership, but because the initiative
      is chaired equally between government and civil society in each country.
      The proposed consultation process for the development of Australia’s
      first NAP is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not provide for
      effective joint civil society and government input into, and oversight
      of, the development of the first NAP. Providing opportunities for
      feedback and comment is not a substitute for participation in finalising
      a draft NAP for government consideration. TIA therefore recommends that
      at least one civil society representative is invited to join the group of
      officials charged with finalising the draft NAP for government
      consideration.
      In the longer term, TIA recommends the establishment of a multi-
      stakeholder oversight group, comprising government, civil society, the
      private sector and the communications sector, to ensure ongoing
      commitment to fulfilling OGP obligations.
      TIA affirms the need to involve a range of departments and agencies
      across Government. An example of where such interdepartmental engagement
      would be beneficial would be necessary and beneficial is ensuring a link
      between the OPG process and the fulfillment of Australia’s commitment to
      develop a plan to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. That
      process should also be multi-stakeholder involving government civil
      society and the private sector.

      Great news that the government is moving in this direction and we look
      forward to progressing this issue together.
      However, I must agree with Peter that the selection of the Grand
      Challenges without any consultation is an issue and somewhat contrary to
      the spirit of the OGP. It could be argued the the current two Grand
      Challenges do not sufficiently address transparency or corruption,
      especially when one considers that the OGP’s self-description prioritises
      transparency, corruption AND governance, (“… a multilateral initiative
      that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote
      transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new
      technologies to strengthen governance.”)
      It was heartening to see mention made of natural resources – this is an
      area that Australia could specialise in and contribute to the global
      movement. With Working Groups on this issue just being established in the
      global OGP movement, it would be great if we could push the envelope.

      This looks like a good consultation process Pia and Co. It is clear what
      will happen next and how we might get involved, it’s been well promoted
      (but I am actively tuned in), there is sufficient time for those
      interested to consider information presented, there are multiple methods
      (and points in the process) to provide input and for Gov to consolidate,
      respond to and consider it.
      I hope we will also see good use of citizen engagement, technology and
      data to understand social issues / community needs and refining service
      delivery; and support the potential in our community to manage public
      resources. I would also like to see public participation in the way we
      deliver, report and monitor delivery of this National Action Plan – not
      just public reporting.

      “The Australian Government with input from its citizens is committed to
      improved democratic practices in line with the OGP Open Government
      Declaration:
      •“to promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and
      harness the power of new technologies to make government more effective
      and accountable.”
      •“to uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to
      improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create
      safer communities”
      •“to embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view
      toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our
      own countries and in an increasingly interconnected world.”
      Grand Challenges
      It is disappointing that the published material in parts suggests
      important decisions about ‘grand challenges’ that may limit commitments
      the government is prepared to consider have been made without any
      consultation.
      For example these statements:
      “through consultation, the aim is for the first Australian Government’s
      National Action Plan to include ambitious actions that support the OGP
      grand challenges of improving public services and better managing public
      resources… Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of
      what will improve public services and improve management of public
      resources, as well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities
      for business and support innovation in Australia.”
      However another sentence brings transparency and accountability and
      public engagement into the picture:
      “Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public
      service delivery, increase the transparency and accountability of
      government, and encourage greater public engagement. It also an
      opportunity for the public, civil society, and the private sector
      to contribute ideas for how government can achieve those goals.”
      Unilateral decisions about the scope of what will be considered would be
      an unfortunate start to a “partnership.”
      Consultation should commence and proceed on the basis of OGP guidance
      that the plan in its final form should “consist of a set of commitments
      that advance transparency, accountability, participation and/or
      technological innovation.”
      http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/develop-a-national-action-
      plan
      Within that broad framework nothing should be ruled out before
      consultation starts.
      As the process moves toward finality there should be no difficulty in
      grouping agreed commitments in a way that addresses one or more of the
      ‘challenges’, the only OGP requirement.
      Framework
      According to the published material:
      “The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead
      Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and
      will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&C will
      work with other agencies across the Australian Public Service and other
      jurisdictions within Australia to develop the NAP….”
      Given the wide range of issues likely to arise, consideration should be
      given to establishing formal inter-departmental, inter-governmental and
      government-civil society mechanisms to play a part at various stages
      during the development of proposals, the determination of priorities and
      action taken to implement commitments.
      OGP related issues should not be considered in isolation.
      For example during the period ahead the government will develop plans to
      implement the Sustainable Development Goals.
      http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/
      An OGP initiative encourages member countries to link both by signing the
      Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2013
      Agenda for Sustainable Development
      http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/
      OGP_declaration.pdf
      Goal 16 and a number of the related targets are particularly relevant in
      the context of the development of Australia’s national action plan.
      Goal16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable
      development, provide access to justice for all and build effective,
      accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”
      SDG targets for this goal include:
      Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and
      ensure equal access to justice for all;
      Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms;
      Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all
      levels;
      Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-
      making at all levels;
      Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the
      institutions of global governance;
      Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in
      accordance with national legislation and international agreements.
      Australia should sign the Declaration.
      The Government should establish a formal mechanism that ensures co-
      ordinated consideration of OGP, SDG and related strategic policy
      challenges. A high level inter agency group would assist this process.
      If ‘other jurisdictions’ are to be part of the framework (the OGP is
      talking of sub-national and city engagement) that too may require a
      formal mechanism to bring state, territory, city and local government
      along.
      And a joint government stakeholder group or forum to guide the
      partnership process and final decisions on the plan would give proper
      recognition to the fact that OGP decisions require joint ownership
      befitting a partnership.

****** Consultation Stage 2: Commitments Drafting and Live Event ******
Posted on December_14,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh
The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://
      ogpau.wikispaces.com/
    * A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air
      ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to
      the consultation. Please subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list to indicate
      your interest in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to
      present their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where
      and when this forum will take place will be published on this website
      closer to the date.
    * You can add comments to this Stage 2 Blog post (below).
    * Tweet your thoughts to #ogpau.

***** Moderation policy and process *****
We don’t want to hinder any conversations that are taking place on this blog.
The moderation process helps ensure that spam or comments that breach the terms
of use (below) are not published. We aim to publish most comments immediately.
To help us do this, please make sure:
    * Your comments are relevant or on-topic;
    * Your comments are not inflammatory, unreasonable or obscene;
    * You are civil and respectful of others and their opinions (including not
      impersonating anyone and not posting someone’s personal information
      without their permission); and
    * Your behaviour is in line with relevant laws.
This blog uses a post-moderation process: your comment is basically published
immediately – after going through some automated system checks.
The first is a human verification step to deter spam bots: when you submit a
comment, you are asked to include a user name and an email address. You don’t
have to include your actual details; you may post under a pseudonym.
Offensive language is automatically checked by the system and comments with
many links in them may be automatically held for moderation (links being a
major part of most comment spam). Comments being held in the system are
manually checked by a moderator to determine if the comment should be
published, edited or deleted. The same manual process is applied to a published
comment found to have breached the terms of use. If a comment is edited, we
will include a reference so you can tell.
In most cases, we’ll close comments on posts after 3 months. This is primarily
to block spam comments from appearing on older posts; if you wish to provide
feedback on or discuss an older post, please let us know.
If we make a mistake, again please let us know and we will deal with it as
quickly as we can.

****** Contribute to the process ******
The National Action Plan (NAP) is being developed in collaboration with
citizens and stakeholders across Australia. We are engaging community groups,
private sector, government agencies and everyday citizens who have expressed an
interest in Open Government or the Grand Challenges to get involved.
Over the past year, we have undertaken a number of activities to explore the
breadth of Australian views on the spectrum of open government issues.
    * Raising awareness: public meetings were held in four capital cities in
      late 2015 to raise awareness of Australia’s membership of the Open
      Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first
      National Action Plan. Additional awareness raising activities were
      undertaken through social media, government websites, teleconferences and
      webinars, and email mailing lists.
    * Seeking ideas: a formal consultation process ran from December 2015 to
      April 2016 to seek suggestions on potential commitments for the National
      Action Plan. This included a formal submission process, teleconferences
      with stakeholders, and a workshop with over 60 participants in April 2016
      to help prioritise potential commitments for the Plan. All timeframes for
      consultation and submissions were published online.
    * Drafting the National Action Plan: an Interim Working Group, comprising
      equal representation of government officials and non-government members,
      was established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the
      drafting of the National Action Plan, building on earlier consultations.
We are now seeking public submissions on the draft National Action Plan ahead
of submitting the Plan to the Open Government Partnership by the end of 2016.

****** An update from the coordination team, and a reminder to contribute to
Stage 2 ******
Posted on December_22,_2015  by  Helen_Owens
I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

=========================================================================
****** Appendix A: Consultation and engagement activities ******
Consultation and engagement on the National Action Plan commenced in November
2015. engage2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged
by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to help design and lead the
consultation process up until April 2016.
A summary of the consultation and engagement activities is provided below. A
more detailed report on engagement activities is available on the OGP Australia
blog (ogpau.govspace.gov.au).
Contents
    * 1_Public_meetings_and_other_awareness_raising_activities
    * 2_Seeking_ideas_for_the_National_Action_Plan
    * 3_Government_engagement
    * 4_Interim_Working_Group
***** Public meetings and other awareness raising activities *****
    * Four public information sessions were held in November 2015 to provide an
      overview of the Open Government Partnership and the process to develop
      Australia’s first National Action Plan. The sessions, held in Sydney,
      Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, were attended by a total of 162 people,
      with a further 45 people watching the livestreams online.
    * The OGP Australia blog and an email distribution list were established to
      provide public updates on progress and to inform stakeholders of
      engagement opportunities.
    * The hashtag #OGPau was created to discuss the project on social media,
      including through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s
      Twitter account.
***** Seeking ideas for the National Action Plan *****
    * A wiki (ogpau.wikispaces.com) was created to provide an interactive and
      collaborative forum for stakeholders to suggest commitments that could be
      included in the National Action Plan. Almost 1000 people visited the wiki
      between February and May 2016, and around 200 suggestions were put
      forward (all available online on the wiki and blog, including a summary).
    * On 12 April 2016, a workshop was held in Canberra to discuss and
      prioritise the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. The
      workshop was attended by 63 people, with a mix of government, civil
      society, OGP Support Unit and other participants.
    * 14 commitment templates were drafted during the workshop, covering areas
      such as open data, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protection, beneficial
      ownership, public participation and the Extractive Industries
      Transparency Initiative. The templates were further considered within
      government and informed the drafting of the National Action Plan.
***** Government engagement *****
An Inter-Departmental Committee was established to ensure the interests of
Australian Government agencies were considered in the development of the
National Action Plan. This Committee was chaired by the Department of the Prime
Minister and Cabinet with participation from high level officials from the
following agencies:
    * Attorney-General’s Department
    * Australian Bureau of Statistics
    * Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
    * Australian Electoral Commission
    * Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
    * Australian Public Service Commission
    * Department of Agriculture and Water Resources
    * Department of Communications and the Arts
    * Department of Defence
    * Department of Education and Training
    * Department of Employment
    * Department of the Environment and Energy
    * Department of Finance
    * Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
    * Department of Health
    * Department of Human Services
    * Department of Immigration and Border Protection
    * Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
    * Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
    * Department of Social Services
    * Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
    * The Treasury
    * Department of Veterans’ Affairs
    * Digital Transformation Agency
    * National Archives of Australia
    * Office of the Australian Information Commissioner
The Committee met four times and also considered material out-of-session,
including the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. Government
ministers were also briefed on commitments that fall within their area of
responsibility and on the Open Government Partnership more broadly.
***** Interim Working Group *****
An Interim Working Group was established in August 2016 to provide input and
help inform the drafting of the National Action Plan. The Group comprised equal
representation of senior government officials and stakeholder representatives:
    * Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair): Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime
      Minister and Cabinet;
    * Ms Fiona McLeod (co-chair): President-elect of the Law Council of
      Australia;
    * Dr Stein Helgeby: Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance;
    * Mr Iain Anderson: Deputy Secretary, Attorney-General’s Department;
    * Mr Timothy Pilgrim: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting Australian
      Information Commissioner;
    * Ms Meghan Quinn: First Assistant Secretary, the Treasury;
    * Ms Anne Lyons: Assistant Director-General, National Archives of
      Australia;
    * The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the Accountability
      Round Table;
    * Ms Maree Adshead: CEO of Open Data Institute Queensland;
    * Mr Peter Timmins: Interim Convenor of the Australian OGP Civil Society
      Network;
    * Mr Mark Zirnsak: Director of Justice and International Mission, Synod of
      Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia; and
    * Ms Katherine Szuminska: Co-Founder and Director of the OpenAustralia
      Foundation.
The NSW Information Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Tydd, also sat as a non-voting
jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire to build stronger
relationships with the states on open government matters.
The group worked together to identify and explore in detail the potential
commitments for the National Action Plan, building on ideas put forward from
earlier consultations. The group also considered the text of other parts of the
National Action Plan, and the approach to broader consultation and engagement
on the draft Plan. Members also facilitated targeted consultation with their
wider networks throughout the process.
In addition to regular teleconferences and email correspondence, the Group held
three face-to-face meetings in Canberra, and a workshop in Sydney, which
included an hour discussion with the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital
Transformation, the Hon Angus Taylor MP.
Agenda papers, meeting minutes and the outcomes of discussions with the Group
have been posted regularly on the OGP Australia blog.

=========================================================================
****** Australia’s leadership internationally ******
This National Action Plan focuses on domestic initiatives, but Australia also
plays an important role in promoting more effective governance in the Indo-
Pacific region and beyond.
We will continue to support countries in our region to build institutions that
promote stability, inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and gender
equality. We will also maintain our support for strengthened dialogue between
governments, non-government organisations, the public and the private sector,
so that they can make legitimate demands of their governments.
Australia’s development cooperation program supports a diverse range of
countries, from highly populous Indonesia to the micro-states of the Pacific.
Australia therefore tailors its cooperation to address the varied economic,
political and social factors constraining effective governance in each country
context, including through:
    * reducing opportunities for corruption by strengthening checks and
      balances, access to information and complaints processes;
    * assisting partner governments to reform tax policy and administration and
      improve public financial management;
    * strengthening regulatory and legal environments so that businesses have
      greater certainty and predictability;
    * supporting the public and businesses to resolve disputes through formal
      legal systems, alternative mechanisms or institutions that combine both;
    * promoting gender equality and enhancing women’s voice in decision-making,
      leadership and peace-building; and
    * building coalitions and opportunities for discussion across government,
      business, non-government organisations and the public to improve public
      policy and government accountability.
Australia is committed to the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the
Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. The National Action
Plan will support the achievement of the SDGs in Australia and globally, in
particular Goal 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and
effective institutions. Australia strongly advocated for this goal, which will
be critical for the success of the entire 2030 Agenda.
Australia will also endorse the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which commits us
to transparency, openness and accountability in our domestic and international
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As a member of the Open Government Partnership, we also note our responsibility
to work globally to fight corruption, empower citizens and enhance transparency
and integrity. We will continue to work with other countries to help achieve
these goals, including through our support for the effective implementation of
the UN Convention against Corruption and the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative in Australia, our region and beyond. Australia will also continue to
participate actively in forums such as the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group
and OECD Development Assistance Committee networks on governance, conflict and
fragility.

=========================================================================
****** 1.1 – Improve whistle-blower protections in the tax and corporate
sectors ******
We will improve whistle-blower protections for people who disclose information
about tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office. We will also consult on
other reform options to strengthen and harmonise whistle-blower protections in
the corporate sector with those in the public sector.
Objective
Australia will ensure appropriate protections are in place for people who
report tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste, fraud and misconduct within
the corporate sector.
Status Quo
The prevention of tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud relies
upon appropriate protections for people who report these wrongdoings.
Australian public servants who act as whistle-blowers already have significant
protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act). This is in
contrast to Australia’s corporate whistle-blower framework, which lags behind
the PID Act. Current protections are overly narrow and make it unnecessarily
difficult for those with information to qualify for protections.
A research project into public interest whistleblowing, Whistling While They
Work 2, led by Griffith University, is currently underway and looking into
improvements across the public and private sectors.
In the 2016-17 Budget, the Government announced it would introduce
whistle‑blower protections for people who disclose information about tax
misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office.
Ambition
To reduce tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud by protecting
people who report such activities.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of public accountabilityand
transparency by:
    * encouraging, protecting and compensating whistle-blowers whose
      information reveals artificial tax structures and misconduct;
    * reducing tax misconduct and other forms of corruption, fraud and waste by
      ensuring whistle-blowers are protected from retribution; and
    * ensuring tax and corporate private sector whistle-blowers have similar
      protections to public sector whistle‑blowers.
OGP Grand Challenge
    * Increasing Corporate Accountability
    * More Effectively Managing Public Resources
Timeframes
December 2016 – December 2017

=========================================================================
****** 1.2 – Beneficial ownership ******
We will consult with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and the
public on a beneficial ownership register for companies.
Objective
Australia will work to improve transparency of information on beneficial
ownership and control of companies available to competent authorities.
Status Quo
Improving transparency around who owns and benefits from financial arrangements
is key to protecting the integrity of our financial systems and preventing the
misuse of financial entities for corruption and criminal activity. A beneficial
ownership register shows who ultimately benefits from the activities of
companies.
Australia currently has tracing powers for beneficial ownership of listed
companies and investment schemes but there is room to strengthen these
provisions.
Ambition
To ensure that adequate, accurate and timely information on beneficial
ownership and control is available to competent authorities in Australia.
To improve regional and international cooperation on taxation, including
strengthening information sharing between tax authorities and sharing learnings
to increase the transparency of beneficial ownership information. We will use
outcomes of the work by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Global
Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes this year to
help develop proposals to improve implementation of relevant international
standards on transparency, including on the availability and exchange of
companies’ beneficial ownership information.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public
accountability by:
    * improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional
      frameworks;
    * preventing the misuse of financial arrangements for illicit purposes such
      as corruption, tax evasion and money laundering;
    * protecting the integrity of the financial system; and
    * increasing growth through private sector investment.
OGP Grand Challenge
    * Increasing Corporate Accountability

      international standards on transparency, including on the availability of
      beneficial ownership information and its international exchange.2) The
      use of nominee shareholdings to conceal beneficial ownership, including
      potential solutions.
          o End 2016
   2. Public consultation
          o End 2016 – Early 2017
   3. Recommendation to Government on the details, scope and implementation of
      a register of beneficial ownership of companies.

=========================================================================
****** 1.3 – Natural Resource Transparency ******
We will work together to enhance disclosure of company payments and government
revenues from oil, gas and mining.
Objective
Australia will work towards compliance with the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard and continue to support the application
of EITI principles around the world.
Status Quo
The sustainable development of natural resources (oil, gas and minerals)
requires transparent and accountable management of revenue received from these
industries, including taxes, royalties and other payments.
The EITI is a global standard to promote the open and accountable management of
natural resources. The Australian Government has been a major supporter of the
EITI, committing more than A$20 million since 2007.
Australia announced its intention to seek EITI compliance on 6 May 2016,
following a pilot to test the applicability of EITI rules and principles to
Australian conditions between 2011 and 2014. This requires us to report
annually on governance and payments in the oil, gas and mining sectors.
The oil, gas and mining industries face increasing scrutiny. Our commitment to
the EITI standard will help to build the public trust necessary for an enduring
and sustainable industry.
Ambition
To enhance transparency and accountability in the extractive industries sector.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public
accountability by:
    * providing timely, reliable, publicly available and independently verified
      data on the extractives industries’ contribution to the Australian
      economy;
    * encouraging EITI adoption in resource-rich countries and support a level
      playing field for Australian companies seeking to invest in those
      markets;
    * demonstrating Australia’s commitment to global transparency, anti-
      corruption and tackling tax avoidance; consistent with current domestic
      and international trends; and
    * supporting the extractive industries’ social licence to operate,
      demonstrating its commitment to transparent and accountable operations.
OGP Grand Challenge
    * Increasing Corporate Accountability
    * More Effectively Managing Public Resources
Timeframes
September 2016 – Mid 2019
Lead agency
Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
Other actors involved
Government: Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of the Prime
Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, Australian Taxation Office, state and territory

=========================================================================
****** 2.1 – Release high-value datasets and enable data driven innovation
******
We will work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to release
high-value public datasets and drive social and economic outcomes.
Objective
Australia will continue to make more public data openly available and support
its use to launch commercial and non-profit ventures, conduct research, make
data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.
Status Quo
Public data is a valuable national resource and its use and reuse can help grow
the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy outcomes.
While significant progress has been made to advance the public data agenda
within Australia, further work needs to be done to harness the full value of
this resource. Ongoing engagement is required to identify the characteristics
of high-value datasets and discover barriers to accessing and sharing data.
The public, research, not-for-profit and private sectors can innovate with this
data in order to generate new business, develop new products and services, and
create social value.
The Government has provided some support to date, including through the Open
Data 500 Australia  and the DataStart initiative.  There is now the opportunity
to build and expand on these pilot initiatives to encourage the use of public
data for social and economic outcomes.
In the Government’s policy for Better and More Accessible Digital Services, the
Government committed to working with research, not-for-profit and private
sectors to identify high-value public datasets for release. This will be
supported by a public registry of significant non sensitive datasets yet to be
published on data.gov.au. The Government is also establishing a $50 million
Smart Cities and Suburbs Program to incentivise local councils to open up their
data and collaborate with communities, local business, not-for-profits and
research institutes to create innovative solutions to urban problems.
The Productivity Commission is undertaking an inquiry into data availability
and use that will also identify the characteristics (and provide examples) of
public datasets that would provide high value to the public, research and
private sectors, as well as the community.
Ambition
To develop an open dialogue between government and non-government sectors to
identify high-value datasets and to stimulate greater use and re‑use of public
data in innovative ways.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information,
technology and innovation andpublic participation by:
    * identifying and prioritising high-value datasets for priority release;
    * understanding how Australian businesses and not-for-profits are using
      public data;
    * stimulating use and re-use of public data in innovative ways;
    * encouraging the use of public data to create social value;
    * identifying, facilitating and addressing barriers impeding the sharing of
      and access to data; and
    * fostering a dialogue on how public data can be made more useful.

=========================================================================
****** 2.2 – Build and maintain public trust to address concerns about data
sharing ******
We will develop an ongoing and collaborative conversation with the community to
build public trust around data sharing and integration.
Objective
Australia will actively engage with the community regarding how public data is
being used to provide more targeted and effective policy, service delivery and
program evaluation.
Status Quo
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, effective policy responses
require investment in joined-up data that can provide a strong evidence-base
for policy decisions.
The New Zealand Government has invested in both a whole-of-government
Integrated Data Infrastructure and enhanced analytical capability with positive
results in terms of reduced government spending and improved public policy
outcomes in areas such as human rights, law enforcement, health, education and
justice.
While the Australian Public Service (APS) has made some progress in this area,
we need to better inform the community about the benefits of data sharing and
address public concerns, including perceived values, risks, and attitudes
towards privacy.
The Privacy Act 1988 underpins the open data agenda and helps build public
trust in data-sharing activities. The Government has introduced a Bill to amend
the Act to make it an offence to deliberately re-identify personal information
from open government data.
Data literacy across the APS is also critical. In August 2016, the Department
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet released Data Skills and Capability in the
Australian Public Service to help build skills and knowledge in publishing,
linking and sharing public data.
Ambition
To build trust about the use of integrated data and actively respond to
community concerns about data sharing. To comply with international best
practice on open data principles and participate in global fora on data.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency and public
participation by:
    * providing greater transparency on how government is using the data it
      collects and protecting personal information;
    * enabling the community to engage with government and raise issues of

****** 2.3 – Digitally transform the delivery of government services ******
We will continue to invest in digital technologies to make government services
simpler, faster and cheaper.
Objective
Australia will harness digital technologies to make it easier for the public to
work and interact with government.
Status Quo
The Digital Transformation Agency is an executive agency within the Prime
Minister’s portfolio. Its mission is to lead the transformation of government
services to deliver a better experience for Australians.
Innovative use of digital technologies supports the open government agenda,
through the provision of faster, cheaper and more accessible government
services. While some progress has been made, there is an opportunity to seize
the benefits of the digital revolution to improve the way government interacts
with the public.
The Digital Transformation Agency will work with government agencies to deliver
a roadmap for the digital transformation of government services and will use
public dashboards to measure its performance, which will be benchmarked against
best practice in the private sector.
Ambition
To use digital technologies to promote transparency and public participation in
government service delivery, engaging early and often with users throughout, so
that government services meet the needs of the people who use them.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of technology and innovation and
transparency by:
    * increasing public access to government services;
    * making government services more efficient and cheaper; and
    * increasing transparency around performance of government service
      delivery.

=========================================================================
****** 3.1 – Information management and access laws for the 21st century ******
We will ensure our information access laws are modern and appropriate for the
digital information age.
Objective
Australia will consider options for reforms to the framework for managing and
accessing government information, including the Freedom of Information Act 1982
(FOI Act), the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act) and, where relevant, the
Privacy Act 1988 (with primary focus on the Archives Act and FOI Act), as well
as policies and practices relating to information access and management.
Status Quo
In 2010, the Australian Government passed reforms to the FOI Act as part of a
broader plan to improve transparency and to encourage public engagement in
decision making. The 2010 reforms also included the introduction of the
Information Publication Scheme, which requires agencies to provide a broad
range of information on their websites, and amendments to the Archives Act to
reduce the open access period for Commonwealth records from 30 to 20 years over
a 10 year period.
There have since been a number of reviews recommending changes to the FOI Act,
including Dr Allan Hawke’s Review of Freedom of Information Laws and the
Belcher Red Tape Review. Among other things, the Belcher Red Tape Review
recommended the Attorney-General’s Department “begin work with relevant
entities to scope and develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework
for managing and accessing government information during its life-cycle in a
digital environment through staged reforms, commencing with legislation
regulating archives.”
The core frameworks of Australia’s information access laws (in particular the
FOI Act and the Archives Act) have not been substantially altered since enacted
in the early 1980s, when government operated in a paper-based environment. It
is therefore appropriate to consider how access to government information is
best managed into the future within the context of digital government.
Ambition
To develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework for managing and
accessing government information within the context of digital government,
supported by efficient and effective policies and practices.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public
accountability by:
    * ensuring government information access laws are modern and capable of
      meeting the demands of the digital age;
    * increasing awareness of public access rights to government information;
      and
    * improving efficiency of processing access to information requests.

=========================================================================
****** 3.2 – Understand the use of Freedom of Information ******
We will work with states and territories to collect and publish uniform data on
public use of freedom of information access rights in Australia.
[Freedom of information is used generally to cover legislated public access
right to information schemes across all jurisdictions. For example, in New
South Wales the relevant legislation is the Government Information (Public
Access) Act 2009 (NSW).]
Objective
Australia will develop uniform metrics to better measure and improve our
understanding of the public’s use of rights under freedom of information laws.
Status Quo
The Commonwealth, states and territories already collect data and produce
statistics about applications to access government information in each
jurisdiction. For example, the Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner currently releases statistics on access requests under the Freedom
of Information Act 1982 through data.gov.au.
However, the data collected is not uniform across jurisdictions, making it
difficult to compare and analyse how freedom of information rights are used
across the country. The development of consistent metrics will assist in
building a more complete picture of freedom of information rights in Australia
and could help governments improve processing of information access requests.
Metrics could include the type of applicant, application rates per capita,
release rates, review rates and refusal rates.
Ambition
To raise awareness about the public’s rights to access government information
under freedom of information laws and enable quantitative analysis of data
across jurisdictions. This will improve understanding of utilisation of access
rights, government processes and practices, and better align with established
international metrics including the World Justice Project Open Government
Index.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public
accountability by:
    * increasing awareness of public access rights to government information;
    * enabling comparison of freedom of information access rights across
      jurisdictions and internationally; and
    * improving freedom of information access practices and efficiency of
      processing access to information requests.

=========================================================================
****** 3.3 – Improve the discoverability and accessibility of government data
and information ******
We will make it easier for the public to find and use government data and
information through central portals and digital platforms.
Objective
Australia will establish platforms and tools to improve the discoverability and
accessibility of government information and public data.
Status Quo
The creation, preservation, management and public use of government information
is fundamental to open and transparent government. The availability of
government records and data improves public access to information, while also
driving efficient business outcomes by facilitating use and reuse of these
valuable resources.
It is not enough just to make these resources open; information and public data
must be easy to find and accessible in order for it to be useful. Some specific
examples of areas where the government is seeking to improve public access to
information include:
    * Public data: Data.gov.au is the Australian Government’s open data
      platform. It has enabled the open release of over 20,000 public resources
      used to grow the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy
      outcomes for the nation. As the number of datasets on data.gov.au grows,
      Australia’s public data infrastructure needs be upgraded to meet the
      demands of data users. This includes improving search and discovery,
      enhancing support for collaboration, developing a quality framework to
      assist publishers, and developing more robust publishing processes.
    * Grants: There is no central point to identify and apply for Australian
      Government grant opportunities and find consolidated information about
      grants awarded. The Department of Finance is building GrantConnect, a
      central whole-of-government system that will forecast and publish grant
      opportunities, automatically notify public users of grant opportunities
      of interest, and publish information on grants awarded.
    * Corporate and administrative reporting: Corporate and administrative
      reporting information is currently located on individual agency websites
      or in hard copy, making it difficult to compare and contrast documents.
      The Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and
      Cabinet are working with the Digital Transformation Agency to make
      reporting information more discoverable and accessible through the
      digitisation of this information.
    * Archived records: The most significant records of the Australian
      Government are held by the National Archives of Australia. To facilitate
      citizens’ access to these records through digital and online channels,
      the Archives will continue to lead the transition from paper to digital
      information practices in Australian Government agencies, digitise paper
      records of high research value and increase the number of records
      available for public access.
    * Environmental information: The Department of the Environment and Energy
      compiles significant data to produce its State of the Environment report
      and meet its other responsibilities (such as research into the impacts of
      coal and coal seam gas developments on ground water). The Department will
      make the 2017 State of the Environment report and its underlying data
      more accessible through SoE Digital (an innovative and interactive online
      platform) and data.gov.au. It will use data visualisation tools to help
      publish the results of its coal and coal seam gas bioregional
      assessments.
Ambition
To make it as easy as possible to find, access and use government information
and data.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
technology and innovation by:
    * promoting a consistent approach to information governance across
      Australian Government entities;
    * increasing transparency of government decision-making and policy
      development;
    * enabling information and data reuse for economic and social benefits;
    * protecting the rights and entitlements of Australians to access
      government information;

=========================================================================
****** 4.2 – National Integrity Framework ******
We will collaborate with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and
the public to strengthen our national anti-corruption and integrity framework.
Objective
Australia will strengthen our ability to prevent, detect and respond to bribery
and corruption. As part of this, we will regularly review the jurisdiction and
capabilities of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI)
and the Australian Federal Police’s Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre to ensure
they can focus on protecting Commonwealth agencies from risks of corruption.
Status Quo
The Government takes a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to combating
corruption, under which a range of agencies play a role in preventing,
detecting and responding to corruption. We have strong laws applying to bribery
and corruption which carry significant penalties.
ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious issues
of corruption in agencies within its jurisdiction. ACLEI’s jurisdiction
focusses on protecting environments that are most at risk of criminal
compromise—namely, border regulation and law enforcement.
The Integrity Commissioner considers the nature and scope of corruption
revealed by investigations, and reports annually on any patterns and trends in
corruption in Australian Government law enforcement and other government
agencies which have law enforcement functions. Accordingly, ACLEI collects
intelligence about corruption in support of the Integrity Commissioner’s
functions.
ACLEI also aims to understand corruption and prevent it. Where the Integrity
Commissioner identifies laws of the Commonwealth or administrative practices of
government agencies that might contribute to corrupt practices or prevent their
early detection, he or she may make recommendations for these laws or practices
to be changed.
As a practitioner agency, ACLEI engages actively with other government agencies
and civil society (nationally and internationally) to collect and share
information to strengthen anti-corruption arrangements in Australia and abroad.
ACLEI’s dissemination program of Information Reports is one means by which the
Integrity Commissioner transmits timely intelligence to relevant agencies, such
as to police and other integrity agencies. ACLEI and the AFP Fraud and Anti-
Corruption Centre (FACC) also cross-refer information to one another, and
assist one another with corruption prevention activities.
In 2014, the Government established the FACC located in the AFP headquarters to
bring together a range of Commonwealth agencies to assess, prioritise and
respond to serious fraud and corruption matters, including across Commonwealth
services, programs and employees. The FACC draws on the collective knowledge of
agencies to provide sound contemporary advice in relation to potential fraud
threats relevant to new government funding initiatives prior to their
implementation. In April 2016, the Government provided an additional $15
million to the FACC to enhance its capacity to detect and investigate
corruption, bribery and serious economic crime.
Between the FACC and ACLEI, there is significant coverage of fraud and
corruption across Australian Government agencies, with a particular focus on
areas of high-corruption risk.
The Government has reviewed ACLEI’s jurisdiction on a number of occasions in
the past and extended its jurisdiction where a need was demonstrated.
In May 2016, the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law
Enforcement Integrity reported on its inquiry into ACLEI’s jurisdiction. Many
public submissions have advocated extension of its coverage to the entire
public sector. The Committee recommended the Government extend ACLEI’s
jurisdiction to include the entire Department of Agriculture and Water
Resources, and examine the feasibility of including the Australian Taxation
Office within ACLEI’s jurisdiction. The Government is considering the report’s
recommendations.
The Government is also exploring new responses to corruption and corporate
crime. In March 2016, the Government released a public discussion paper on a
possible deferred prosecution agreement scheme in Australia. An effective
deferred prosecution agreement scheme could help encourage companies to self-
report criminal behaviour and provide enforcement and prosecutorial agencies
with a new tool to identify and bring corporate offenders to justice.
Ambition
To aim to improve Australia’s score on Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index.
To regularly review the jurisdiction and capabilities of ACLEI and FACC, and
extend these on an as-needs basis.
To consult closely with industry, non-government organisations and the public
to ensure that our law, policies and frameworks for responding to corruption
are effective, including through holding the first government business
roundtable on corruption in 2017. We will also consult publicly on the
implementation of recommendations from the Statutory Review of the Anti-Money
Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and associated Rules and
Regulations.
To ensure that our laws applying to the bribery of foreign public officials
facilitate effective prosecution.
To assess whether a deferred prosecution agreement scheme would facilitate more
effective and efficient responses to bribery and corporate corruption by
encouraging companies to self-report.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public
accountability by:
    * improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional
      frameworks; and
    * protecting the integrity and transparency of the execution of public
      policy and management.

****** 4.3 – Open Contracting ******
We will undertake a public review of the Australian Government’s compliance
with the Open Contracting Data Standard.
Objective
Australia will review compliance with the Open Contracting Data Standard and
continue to support the Open Contracting Global Principles.
Status Quo
The Open Contracting Data Standard sets out key documents and data that should
be published at each stage of government procurement and is seen as the
international benchmark. The Standard enables disclosure of data and documents
at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It
was created to support organisations to increase contracting transparency, and
allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.
In line with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, Australian Government entities
are required to report all procurement contracts with a value of $10,000 or
more on AusTender. However, there has not been a formal assessment of the
extent to which current practice meets the requirements of the Open Contracting
Data Standard.
At the UK Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016, the Australian Government stated
its support of the Open Contracting Data Standard and noted the role that the
Standard could play in encouraging machine-readable open data formats across
all areas of government.
Ambition
To enhance transparency and accountability of public money in delivering public
contracts.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values ofaccess to information and public
accountability by demonstrating transparency and accountability in relation to
the procurement of goods and services on behalf of the Government.

****** 5.1 – Delivery of Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan
******
We will ensure that Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan is a
platform for ongoing dialogue, collaboration and open government reform.
Objective
Australia will establish a permanent dialogue mechanism with civil society,
which includes a multi stakeholder forum. The multi-stakeholder forum will
track the implementation of commitments, ensure commitments continue to be
relevant and ambitious, inform the drafting of future National Action Plans and
raise awareness about open government in the broader community.
Status Quo
OGP countries are required to establish a multi-stakeholder forum to consult
with the public and organisations outside of government on the implementation
of the commitments included in their National Action Plan. Detailed guidance on
establishing a multi-stakeholder forum is outlined in the OGP’s handbook.
OGP countries have taken different approaches to establishing their multi-
stakeholder forum. Some models adopted in other countries include:
    * Civil society network: Coalition of non-government organisations and
      individuals.
    * Single forum: Convenes government, the public and organisations outside
      of government in one formally established, central committee for co-
      ordination.
    * Hub-and-spoke: Network of smaller forums (broken down by sector, thematic
      area or commitments etc.), which may be coordinated by a central
      committee.
The Government will work in partnership with civil society to determine the
structure, role, governance and membership of the OGP multi stakeholder forum.
This may include setting up or continuing interim structures until a permanent
forum can be established.
It is also important that Australia’s commitments remain relevant and ambitious
throughout the National Action Plan cycle. This will be achieved through
ongoing review of milestones, with updates made (as necessary) in partnership
with civil society. The Government will also work with the public to identify
any additional commitments that could be included in the National Action Plan
over the two year cycle.
Ambition
To identify, develop and implement ambitious open government commitments
through ongoing partnership with civil society.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of public participation and
accountability by:
    * ensuring commitments remain relevant and ambitious throughout the
      National Action Plan cycle;
    * keeping government accountable for the implementation of National Action
      Plan commitments;
    * raising awareness about the Open Government Partnership and open
      government matters in Australia and the region; and
    * ensuring participation by a broad and diverse range of organisations and
      the public in the development of National Action Plan commitments.

=========================================================================
****** 5.2 – Enhance public participation in government decision making ******
We will work together to improve public participation in government decision
making for better policy development and service delivery outcomes.
Objective
Australia will work towards improving public participation and engagement to
enhance policy and service delivery outcomes for Australians.
Status Quo
Government is comprised of a diverse range of organisations, with approaches to
participation varying considerably across different departments and agencies.
High barriers to participation and piecemeal or unpredictable approaches to
consultation can lead to an inefficient and dissatisfying experience. The
current mechanisms for consultation, which are adapted from other online
processes, often do not fully meet the Government’s practical requirements for
policy and program development.  In addition, current mechanisms can be
ineffective in enabling ‘co-design’.
Numerous reviews have highlighted scope for improvement in the way the
Australian Public Service engages with the public when developing policies and
programs. For example, Peter Shergold’s Learning from Failure recommended that
“the APS should promote new forms of civil participation, including digital and
deliberative democracy techniques, in order to enhance consumer-directed care,
improve customer service, encourage greater public engagement and inform the
public economy”.
There is a need to identify and disseminate information on good practices and
help peer exchange between government agencies and across different levels of
government. Digital technologies also open up new opportunities for engagement
and there are a range of innovative techniques that could be further explored
at the Commonwealth level (e.g. policy hacks, online challenge platforms and
citizen juries). In addition, there has been a lack of investment in social
media and on-line tools relevant to public participation in government
decision-making.
The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 also requires
Commonwealth entities to work cooperatively with others to achieve common
objectives, where practicable.
Ambition
To design and adopt a whole-of-government framework that embeds meaningful,
open, public and multi-stakeholder participation into the business of policy
development and service delivery.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency, accountability and
public participation by:
    *     o facilitating informed public participation;
          o improving policy development and service delivery;
          o enhancing transparency around government decision making;
          o encouraging an ongoing sharing of information and views across
            interest groups that builds consensus on broad policy directions;
            and
          o creating more engaged private and community sectors, and public.

=========================================================================
****** Developing this plan ******
The National Action Plan has been drafted through a process of consultation and
collaboration between government, non-government organisations (including the
Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network), the public and
the private sector.
Over the past year, we undertook a number of activities to explore the breadth
of Australian views on the spectrum of open government issues.
    * Raising awareness: public meetings were held in four capital cities in
      late 2015 to raise awareness of Australia’s membership of the Open
      Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first
      National Action Plan. Additional awareness raising activities were
      undertaken through social media, government websites, teleconferences and
      webinars, and email mailing lists.
    * Seeking ideas: a formal consultation process ran from December 2015 to
      April 2016 to seek suggestions on potential commitments for the National
      Action Plan. This included a formal submission process, teleconferences
      with stakeholders, and a workshop with over 60 participants in April 2016
      to help prioritise potential commitments for the Plan. All timeframes for
      consultation and submissions were published online.
    * Drafting the National Action Plan: an Interim Working Group, comprising
      equal representation of government officials and non-government members,
      was established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the
      drafting of the National Action Plan, building on earlier consultations.
This engagement has helped shape the National Action Plan and the open
government priorities for the next two years. More details about engagement
activities are provided at Appendix A.

FILE: ogpau.govspace.gov.au_draft-national-action-plan_efforts-to-date_index.html.txt
=========================================================================
****** Efforts to date ******
The Australian Government has already taken a range of steps towards improving
transparency, integrity and anti‑corruption in recent years, which this
National Action Plan will build upon.
Open data and digital transformation of government services are high priorities
for the Government and considerable progress has been made in a short space of
time.
    * The Public Data Policy Statement, released in December 2015, commits
      Australian Government entities to release non-sensitive data as open by
      default. Since 2013, the number of discoverable resources on data.gov.au
      has grown from approximately 500 to over 20,000.
    * TheDigital Transformation Agency(formerly the Digital Transformation
      Office) has been established to lead the online transformation of
      government services, and provide an integrated policy and strategic
      capability for whole of government ICT, ICT procurement and digital. The
      Digital Transformation Agency will implement wide scale change in digital
      capability across government departments, benefiting the public and other
      users of government services.
There have been several major initiatives to improve accountability and
integrity both within and outside of government.
    * The Government commissioned an independent review of the parliamentary
      entitlements system in August 2015, and has given its in-principle
      support to all of the recommendations of the review.
    * TheRoyal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruptionreported in
      December 2015. The Government has introduced legislation to improve the
      governance and accountability of registered organisations (unions and
      employer organisations).
Steps have been taken to make government procurement more transparent, and to
encourage innovation by making it easier for start-ups and innovative small
businesses to sell services to government.
    * The National Innovation and Science Agenda committed to establish a new
      Digital Marketplace for procuring ICT products and services, and seeking
      innovative solutions to policy and service delivery “challenges” through
      the Business Research and Innovation Initiative.
    * A public ICT dashboard is being developed to improve transparency around
      Government ICT performance and progress on major new investments.
The Australian Government has also been active (and in many cases a leader) in
international anti‑corruption and tax avoidance / transparency efforts.
    * Australia is a key member of the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group,
      having led the development of the G20 Anti‑Corruption Action Plan and the
      subsequent 2015-16 Anti‑Corruption Implementation Plan. The G20 High
      Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency are also a legacy
      item of Australia’s 2014 G20 presidency.
    * Australia was also an active participant in the UK’s international anti-
      corruption summit in London in May 2016. At the meeting, the Government
      endorsed the Global Declaration against Corruption and announced a range
      of new measures, including joining the Extractive Industries Transparency
      Initiative and holding an annual government business roundtable on
      corruption.
    * In December 2015, the Australian Taxation Office published the first
      annual Report of Entity Tax Information, which included the Australian
      total income, taxable income and tax paid of large public and private
      companies operating in Australia.
    * The Voluntary Tax Transparency Code, announced as part of the 2016-17
      Budget, is a set of principles and minimum standards to guide medium and
      large businesses on public disclosure of tax information. Adoption of the
      Code is voluntary, and is designed to encourage greater transparency
      within the corporate sector.
These new measures build on other actions taken over the last decade to improve
access to government information and promote transparency and integrity at the
federal level:
    * Whistle-blower protections in the public sector were significantly
      improved by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013, which commenced in
      January 2014.
    * Freedom of information laws were reformed in 2010, and included the
      introduction of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS), which requires
      Australian Government agencies to publish a broad range of information on
      their websites.
    * The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner was established in
      2010 to promote access to government information.
    * The Archives Act 1983 was amended in 2010 to reduce the period before
      which government information and Cabinet documents are released. A
      Digital Transition Policy and Digital Continuity 2020 Policy have also
      been established, requiring government information to be created and
      managed digitally.
    * Creative Commons licensing was adopted in 2010 to accommodate access to
      government information and bring consistency to licensing arrangements.
State, territory and local governments have also undertaken a range of
initiatives to promote transparency, integrity and access to information at a
sub-national level.

=========================================================================
****** Introduction ******
Australia is a successful and stable democracy, with relatively low levels of
corruption and a long, proud history of open government.
In 2015, we were ranked 13th in Transparency International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index, and 9th in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy
Index.
But in a rapidly changing world – transformed by the digital revolution – it is
important Australia boosts its efforts to become even more open, transparent
and accountable, and improve public engagement. This is crucial as we seek to:
    * build a better society for all Australians and be more responsive to the
      expectations of the community;
    * stimulate economic growth and innovation;
    * foster collaboration between government, business, academia, non-
      government organisations and the community; and
    * continue efforts to stamp out corruption, fraud and misconduct.
Governments worldwide are moving towards more open and transparent ways of
working, with 70 countries – including Australia – now signed up to the Open
Government Partnership.
***** What is the Open Government Partnership? *****
The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative established in
2011 that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote
transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies
to strengthen governance.
Membership requires governments to work with civil society to ‘co-create’ a
National Action Plan every two years, with independent reporting on progress.
Civil society is a term used by the Partnership to broadly refer to people and
organisations outside of government, including non government organisations,
business, academia, community groups and the public.
Importantly, the Open Government Partnership doesn’t prescribe standards that
countries should follow – rather it aims to bring governments and citizens of
each country together to define their own priorities for reform.
The Australian Government confirmed its membership of the Open Government
Partnership in November 2015.
This National Action Plan sets out the initial steps the Government will take
to achieve the aim of improving and building confidence in Australian
institutions and democracy, and to uphold the principles in the Open Government
Declaration, including to:
    * promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the
      power of new technologies to make government more effective and
      accountable;
    * uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve
      services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer
      communities; and
    * embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward
      achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own
      country and in an increasingly interconnected world.
The Plan sets out an agenda for the next two years across a broad range of
important areas:
    * Transparency_and_accountability_in_business
    * Open_data_and_digital_transformation
    * Access_to_government_information
    * Integrity_in_the_public_sector
    * Public_participation_and_engagement
As our first National Action Plan, it provides a foundation to continue
engaging with civil society to identify new initiatives and strengthen our
efforts over time. There is also an opportunity going forward to work with
state, territory and local governments to improve transparency and integrity at
all levels of government.

=========================================================================
****** Engagement update – 11 March ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye
Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to

****** Engagement update – 22 March ******
Posted on March_23,_2016  by  amelialoye
We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the
wiki.Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.
Save the date! Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-
create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on
the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to
lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action
with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for
us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.
Need help? This how_to_Suggest_an_Action_document_provides_some_tips. It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.
In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on
the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:
    * Engagement_for_OGP
    * Fiscal_Transparency
    * Fostering_Innovation
    * Freedom_of_Information
    * Government_Integrity
    * Open_Data
    * Public_Participation
    * Public_Service_Delivery
    * Resources_Management
We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each
action suggested.
Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these themes
with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have
also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to
get involved. PM&C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the
11th April workshop.
***** Some questions that emerged during engagement last week *****
    * After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the
      process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?
    * How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of
      the Grand Challenges?
    * What happened to the proposed teleconference?
    * How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?
Responses to your questions
Cocreation – The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting
actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team,
but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra
will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come
together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can
only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host
theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP commitment_templates with you.
Grand challenges – The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges
are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of
these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions
suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will
share more about Government’s position on this soon.
Teleconference –I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to
invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others
who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities,
differences and priorities before the 11th April event.
Working together to prioritise actions – We need to work together to prioritise
suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to
help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop
on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:
    * Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
      discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they
      might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.
    * In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you who
      have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or
      30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we
      can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.
***** Actions that you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Encouraging theme based engagement– I will be running teleconferences
      with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have
      suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about
      this.
    * Encouraging feedback from others on actions –actions have now been themed
      into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are
      looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and
      opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise
      with you at the workshop.
    * Connecting Australians to theworking_groupsand Open Government
      Partnership Support Unit,Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
      shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Networks.
Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will
include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might
be more involved.

=========================================================================
Developing Australia’s first Action
Plan for Open Government
In November 2015, the Australian Government publically committed to the Open
Government Partnership (OGP) - an international agreement to make governments
more open, accountable and responsive.
‘Open Government’ typically refers to the use of open data, public participation, technology and innovation, and ways to
collaborate with stakeholders to achieve greater transparency, accountability and more effective governance.
Each country that commits to the OGP is required to develop a National Action Plan to outline how they will deliver an
Open Government. The Action Plan will reflect the principles of Open Government and detail specific, measureable
ways the Government will achieve them; progress will be evaluated every two years by the OGP.
The National Action Plan must be completed by June 2016 to meet the OGP timetable and is expected to comply with
the OGP requirements. Details about the OGP are available on the OGP website www.opengovpartnership.org.
The Australian Government has chosen two OGP ‘Grand Challenges’ as focus areas for the National
Action Plan:
• Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of citizen services including health, education,
criminal justice, water, electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by fostering public
service improvement or private sector innovation; and
• More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address budgets, procurement, natural resources,
and foreign assistance.
The process for developing the National Action Plan is open. The Australian Government is inviting individuals and
organisations across Australia to suggest actions to include in the Plan and engage2 are working with the Department
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to encourage input. We are looking for your ideas about how the Government can
deliver Open Government to help meet the OGP Grand Challenges.
How you can participate
• Keep up to date and comment on our progress via the website: ogpau.govspace.gov.au
• Suggest an action for the National Action Plan or Comment on drafting of the National Action
at the wiki ogpau.wikispaces.com
• Make a formal submission via email ogp@pmc.gov.au
• Host an event in March – email: amelia@engage2.com.au
In April 2016, 5-15 actions will be selected will be to be workshop into commitments for the National Action Plan.
The timeline for plan development is on the back of this page.

=========================================================================
﻿The Open Government Partnership-
Australia- National Action Plan Stage I1
Submission – Accountability Round Table

The Accountability Round Table
Comments are off
The Accountability Round Table (ART) is a non-partisan group of citizens with diverse backgrounds (academics, lawyers, politicians, journalists, authors) who are gravely concerned about to take who provided to respond to military (sort the opportunity the current erosion of honesty and integrity in our democracy.  ART is dedicated to improving standards of accountability, probity, transparency and democratic practice in all governments and parliaments in Australia.2 We are committed to the objectives of the Open Government Partnership.

We welcome the opportunity to participate as civil society members in the preparation of Australia’s first National Action Plan (NAP) in partnership with the Australian Government.

We thank the Government for the detailed material that has been supplied to the community.

Introduction

We wish to take up the opportunity to respond to the matters on which feedback has been sought by the Government in the first stage of the preparation of Australia’s first NAP.

To do that, we have attempted to take into account the information supplied and to identify what we see as key considerations.

What should guide this new partnership?
First, there are the objectives of the Open Government Partnership of which Australia is now an active member.  The OGP Articles of Governance3 state - ;

“The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a voluntary, multi-stakeholder international initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to their citizenry to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. 4In pursuit of these goals, OGP provides an international forum for dialogue and sharing ideas and experience among governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, all of which contribute to a common pursuit of open government. OGP stakeholders include participating governments as well as civil society and private sector entities that support the principles and mission of OGP.”

Secondly, the OGP opens its Mission Statement as follows;
“OGP’s vision is that more governments become sustainably more transparent, more accountable, and more responsive to their own citizens, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of governance, as well as the quality of services that citizens receive. This will require a shift in norms and culture to ensure genuine dialogue and collaboration between governments and civil society. - See more at: http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/mission-and-strategy#sthash.um8HnjJH.dpuf ”

Thirdly, what we have embarked upon in Australia is a partnership to reform our Commonwealth Parliamentary Democracy. What is the nature and purpose of that Parliamentary Democracy?   Can one do better than state – “Government of the people, by the people, for the people”?

And what principles should guide us participants in Australia’s Open Government Partnership in this reform process?

We submit that there is one fundamental principle that should guide all the participants in this partnership – those holding public office, those assisting them and we the people.  The principle is the “public office public trust principle”. This principle has been long forgotten by the community. It is not and has not been for many years in our consciousness or that of our elected representatives.
It is a simple ethical principle based on the proposition that where you entrust others with power over you and your affairs, they are obliged to exercise those powers for your benefit not theirs.
Translated to the operation of democratic governments, our public officers (elected and non-elected) are entrusted with power, and very substantial sums of our money, to make decisions of enormous significance for the present and future for we, the people, and our children and grandchildren. The public office public trust principle requires that when making decisions they must put the public interest first and in priority to their personal interests and other private interests.
It is equally applicable to the all active participants in Australia’s OPG and should provide guidance when considering issues, evidence and solutions.
It is also a legal principle - part of our common law.
 The legal position was recently described by Sir Gerard Brennan, the former Chief Justice of the High Court, in his speech5 before presenting the ART Commonwealth Parliamentary Integrity Awards.  He said (p3)
“It has long been an established legal principle that a member of Parliament holds “a fiduciary relation towards the public”6 and “undertakes and has imposed upon him a public duty and a public trust”.7  The duties of a public trustee are not identical with the duties of a private trustee but there is an analogous limitation imposed on the conduct of the trustee in both categories.  The limitation demands that all decisions and exercises of power be taken in the interests of the beneficiaries and that duty cannot be subordinated to, or qualified by the interests of the trustee.8
Turning to the question of enforcement, he said (p5):
“True it is that the fiduciary duties of political officers are often impossible to enforce judicially9; the courts will not invalidate a law of the Parliament for failure to secure the public - interest10 – the motivations for political action are often complex – but that does not negate the fiduciary nature of political duty.  Power, whether legislative or executive, is reposed in members of the Parliament by the public for exercise in the interests of the public and not primarily for the interests of members or the parties to which they belong.  The cry “whatever it takes” is not consistent with the performance of fiduciary duty.”

This is not the occasion to explore the scope of the legal principle and its application in our legal system.  Examples include the development of administrative law, the common law criminal offence of misconduct in public office11, sentencing law, and contract law.  Where unfettered statutory discretions are given to ministers such as planning ministers, the common law requires that the minister comply with the principle.12

It may be said that every democratic government, including each of its three branches (the legislature, the executive and the judiciary) is in a unique and very special fiduciary relationship with all its citizens, who are its beneficiaries. They are mega public trusts and we, the people, the beneficiaries.  One of the distinguishing features, however, is that where the trustees fail the beneficiaries in developing policy, we, the beneficiaries, generally cannot seek a remedy in the courts to courts and, as a result, the buck stops with  us.  That is our ultimate responsibility in this our Mega Public Trust. Australia’s Open Government Partnership provides a structure that will enable us, and our Public Trustees, to discharge our responsibilities.

We turn to our response to the Government’s request for feedback on the Government’s proposed Stage I of the National Action Plan development.-

Stage I – National Action Plan development

The proposed plan for Stage I is as follows13:
 “Stage I – Preparation, Framework and History
17 November 2015 – 11 December 2015
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore the OGP website including some of the actions plans from other governments. This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the Stage 1 Blog post comments.
Adding feedback to the draft Background page comments.
Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we need to get the framework right first.”
In providing feedback as to the “vision and framework” and the “Background page”, what should be addressed first?
We submit that before a specific “vision” and “framework” can be established for our first National Action Plan we must have a clear and complete picture of where Australia stands in relation to the stated objects of the OGP, including its “grand challenges” the “commitments” it seeks.
The Background Statement (see Appendix A)
 No national Background will be the same as another. As stated in the OGP Articles of governance (p.17)14
“OGP recognises that all countries start from different baselines. Countries are charged with selecting the grand challenges and related concrete commitments that most relate to their unique country contexts”
The Articles also state that
“governments should begin their OGP national action plans by sharing existing efforts relating to their chosen grand challenge (s) including specific open government strategies and ongoing programs15. Action plans should then set out governments’ OGP commitments16, which stretch government practice beyond its current baseline with respect to the relevant grand challenge. These commitments may build on existing efforts, identify new steps to complete ongoing reforms, or initiate action in an entirely new area. Commitments in country action plans should be ambitious in nature. An ambitious commitment is defined as one that, once completed, will show a demonstrable advancement from action plan to action plan in the grand challenge areas proposed by OGP to openness, transparency, civic participation and accountability”17
We turn to the Government’s draft Background Statement. It is entitled “Australia’s Open Government Efforts to Date”.  It comprises seven sections.  We note that it presents a generally positive statement of the past.
As is stated in the Government’s draft statement, there is much to be proud of in respect of the past history of our Australian democracies in the five grand challenge areas.  It is noticeable, however, that with the exception of the National Commission of Audit (2014) and growth in the data.gov.au service and other areas of the new media (including Platforms for Data Release and Adoption of Creative Commons), all important matters, the bulk of the positive evidence referred to occurred in and prior to 2010.
The picture painted is, however, incomplete.  In the last 20-30 years, the quality of our democracies has significantly changed in ways that have adversely affected the 5 Grand Challenge areas.18
In addition, there are at least two important omissions from this positive statement that need to be included – the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office (2012) and the major reform of the Whistle-blower Protection legislation (2013).
There are also at least two problem areas that we submit need to be included in the Background.
(i) Freedom of Information.
The draft describes in some detail developments in and between 2010 and 2014 starting with the establishment of the OAIC in 2010.  The draft correctly states that over the following four years, with changes made, it became “easier to request information and seek review of FOI decisions”.
The description is incomplete, however, because it should also refer to the other key statutory roles it was given; notably hearing complaints about the handling of FOI applications (instead of the Ombudsman), monitoring the system, and providing guidelines, to agencies and providing independent advice to Government.  Reference, however, is made to the OAIC’s past performance of its statutory role in changing the culture in government (references the Information Publication Scheme (IPS) that is intended to give direction to agencies “to take proactive steps to release standard government information in a consistent way reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of the FOI Act”) and its privacy role (in 2014, the “Australian Privacy Principles (APP) included in the Privacy Act 1988).

But, as pointed out by James Mackay (comment 2 December,) there is no mention of what has occurred since May 2014 as a result of the conduct of the Government in giving effect to its decision to abolish the OAIC. We note that he also mentions Dr Hawke’s 2013 Report and proposal that there be a comprehensive review of the operation of the FOI legislation, something that is yet to occur.  As James Mackay states, there was no recommendation in Dr Hawke’s review that the OAIC be abolished.  His report in fact was positive about the operation of the OAIC.

The Government’s attempt to abolish the OAIC by legislation in 2014 failed in late 2014 because the Senate would not pass the requisite Bill. But it had in the 2014/15 Budget Appropriations, limited its resourcing of the OAIC to 31 December 2014.  By then, the OAIC had, in any event, had to cease to discharge most of its statutory responsibilities.  Since then it has not received the funding needed to enable it to resume those statutory responsibilities although they still exist. In addition it has one Acting Commissioner to discharge functions allocated by legislation to 3 Commissioners. The practical effect has been that the FOI system has returned to its previous failed state which the creation of the OAIC was intended to address – i.e. a de facto abolition of the OAIC.

ART has attempted to communicate with the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister throughout this process.19  The most recent letter from the Attorney-General appears to be one written to the President of the ICJ - a letter dated on 9 September (but received sometime later).20 It was signed by his Chief of Staff, Mr O’Sullivan. The letter appeared to give the impression that thought was being given to resolving the situation. Subsequently, however, the Attorney-Gen at a Senate Committee hearing stated that the Government’s position was unchanged and it intended to seek the abolition of the OAIC. As to the last letter, signed by Mr O’Sullivan, he said he was unable to comment because he was not familiar with it21.

The unfortunate reality is that the de facto abolition of the OAIC, and the stalemate, have seriously weakened the FOI system and have made it more difficult for people to access information held by government and seek review of refusal decisions.  That system that is, and should be, one of the most important parts of our Commonwealth Government Integrity System.

There is also a serious Constitutional aspect to this matter; whether the actions of the Executive Government has breached the constitutional principles vital to our democratic system of government, the separation of powers and the rule of law22 .

We submit that this is a matter that Australia’s Open Government Partnership should meet to discuss and resolve as soon as is possible. Having committed to the OGP, we cannot allow the situation to continue. The solution must also accord with our Partnership’s commitments as a member of the OGP.
As to solutions, ART's proposal is that
the Bill to abolish the OAIC should be withdrawn at the first opportunity when Parliament resumes and
funding should be restored as soon as possible to enable three full time Commissioners to be appointed and adequate staff engaged.( We note that the budget saving said to flow from the abolition of the OAIC was $2.5 million per annum)

We also propose that Australia’s first National Action Plan include a review of the operation of the OAIC to commence at the start of 2017 and to cover the period from its creation in 2010 to the end of 2016.  We suggest that time-frame because there is likely to be value in a consideration of the operation of the OAIC under the different circumstances that will have occurred between 2010 and 2017.
(ii) “Changes in culture”.  We refer to the material under that heading, and the following conclusion;
“Open government practices and advances have a dramatic impact on the federal and state and territory public services. The Australian Public Service is learning to value the contribution which more transparent interactive and open government practices can offer”.
This also appears to relate to the use of modern technology.  On that assumption, we do not challenge the statement.
But to what extent has the culture as to access to information and transparency changed overall?
The history of the OAIC, on and since 2010, would suggest that there is still a strong anti-access culture in government?  We should also bear in mind Public Service Commissioner Lloyd’s recently publicly stated opinion that FOI is ‘very pernicious.’  The reality is that the Government culture is divided about Freedom of Information Systems.  We suggest that this is partly a consequence of the absence of the public office public trust principle from the consciousness of the vast majority of Australians holding public office23.
Restoring it to our consciousness would mean that when requests are made for information, person handling the request would have to approach the task on the basis that
the information is the peoples’ information not the government’s,
the people of Australia, including the person making the application, have the prima facie right to access their information and
the decision should be made on the basis that the public interest must prevail over any personal or private interests that the decision-maker may have or any other public officers or individuals may have.
In relation to the two Grand Challenges identified for action by the Government in Australia’s NAP, there have been significant negative changes in the culture, and therefore the conduct, of our democratic government over the last 20 to 30 years.  But this has in fact occurred in each of the five “Grand Challenge” areas.  In particular, there has been a failure in public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform and addressing corruption.
As to the latter, consider the advice given to public servants by the Commissioner of the Commonwealth Public Service about accepting gifts. We note that not only does it encourage the receipt of gifts, it also sees it as improving relations between, the government and its “stakeholders” – i.e. the stakeholders are not the people of Australia but the people making the gifts.  We note also that there is research about the effectiveness of small gifts in securing advantages24. All the Grand Challenge areas need attention.
We submit that the absence from public ethics of an awareness and consciousness of public office public trust principle has been a significant factor in the deterioration of democratic government in all the areas of the five OGP’s Grand Challenges.
These issues are discussed further in a paper drawing on speeches made by Michelle Grattan and the Hon. Lindsay Tanner, Barry Jones and Fred Chaney.25
We turn to the next issue – “The Vision”
The Vision for the proposed NAP – Government Proposals.
 We refer to the Government’s paper, Consultation Stage I:  Preparation, Framework and History. It refers to Australia’s
“long and proud history of open government, as one of the most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world”, comments that “there is always more that can be done”
and asks us to contribute our thoughts on
“what a future vision for open government could look like in Australia”.
It then gives two examples to consider –
“Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
Open government mean citizens playing a greater part in policy development.”
 We suggest, with respect, that these are not so much visions as specific objectives.  As to visions, in addition to the OGP overarching vision referred to above (p. 2), will the following assist?
In light of Australia’s history in major areas of openness and accountability of government26, it is in a position to, and should take a leadership role in the OGP.
We should also give our Commonwealth democratic system of government and the people of Australia the benefits27 that will flow from an ambitious commitment to the Objectives of the OGP and its principles.

Consider the statement of the UK Prime Minister Mr Cameron: speaking at the Open Government Partnership Summit 2013:
“....the best way to ensure that an economy delivers long-term success, and that success is felt by all of its people, is to have it overseen by political institutions in which everyone can share. Where governments are the servants of the people, not the masters. Where close tabs are kept on the powerful and where the powerful are forced to act in the interests of the whole people, not a narrow clique. That is why the transparency agenda is so important.”

He went on to say –

“So I want to finish by saying this: none of what I’ve outlined today is easy for us politicians. Transparency brings risks – indeed we often find that out here on a day-to-day basis – but it is absolutely critical. Time and again, history has shown us that open governments make for successful nations.”
We submit that what will be critical in guiding the development of the first Australian National Action Plan by the Australian OGP will be the guidance given by the OGP statements of principle and objectives.  It is these that should guide us in identifying the “grand challenges” and the “principles” to be addressed and applied. They also serve the public trust principle.

The Government’s proposed Grand Challenges and Principles
(a) The grand challenges. The Government’s proposed grand challenges that should be pursued and are explained are set out in the National Action Plan Consultation document28.
It there states that the

“The OGP advises that a country’s NA P should consist of 5-15 recommendations, draw on at least one of the five grand challenges defined by the OGP, and address defined National action plan principles”
and that
“at this stage, it is envisioned that the  first Australian Government’s NAP will focus on the two OGP grand challenges29 of:
Improving Public Services - measures that address the full spectrum of citizen   services including health, education, criminal justice, water, electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation; and
More Effectively Managing Public resources – measures that address    budgets, procurement, natural resources and foreign assistance. “

(b) The Principles. It also states that in determining the specific commitments in the NAP (5 – 15 required),
“ Each of the commitments made under an NAP must address at least one of the following principles laid out by the OGP, so please consider these when making your contributions.30
Transparency: Publication of government-held information; proactive or reactive releases of information; Mechanisms to strengthen the right to and open access to information.
Accountability: The rules, regulations and mechanisms in place that call upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon criticisms or requirements made of them, and accept responsibility for failure to perform with respect to laws or commitments. Ideally these should include the public.
Participation: on government policies or programs to provide input or feedback and make contributions that lead to more responsive innovative and effective governance.
Technology and Innovation: Providing citizens with open access to and capability with technology for greater innovation. To be relevant to OGP, these initiatives must advance government transparency, accountability and/or public participation.”

It does not, however, state which of the above principles it envisions Australia’s first NAP should address. This, is a key issue to be addressed.

Guidance in choosing the principles to be applied – Relevant material.
 There is relevant material to be considered in the Articles of Governance. They    state; 31

“While the nature of concrete commitments under any grand challenge area should be flexible and allow for each country’s unique circumstances, all OGP commitments should reflect four core open government principles:

Transparency: government-held information (including on activities and decisions) is open, comprehensive, timely, freely available to the public, and meets basic open data standards (e.g. raw data, machine readability) where formats allow.

Citizen participation: Governments seek to mobilise citizens to engage in public debate, provide input, and make contributions that lead to more responsive, innovative and effective governance.

Public Accountability: Rules, regulations and mechanisms in place call upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon criticisms or requirements made of them, and accept responsibility for failure to perform with respect to laws or commitments.

Technology and Innovation for Transparency and Accountability: Governments embrace the importance of providing citizens with open access to technology, the role of new technologies in driving innovation, and increasing the capacity of citizens to use technology.

Accepting the above Government and OGP statements of the four principles, it follows that the OGP’s requirement is that all OGP member nations
must focus on one of the above principles, but
should focus on the four core principles
in making their commitments.

Focussing on the four should not be an imposition - on the contrary. For example;
How can the Australian Open Government Partnership successfully address the “Technology and Innovation” principle without also addressing the “Transparency”, “Participation”, and “Accountability” principles?
The participants in the Australian Partnership must also address their public trust obligations and do so by focusing on the four principles because that will best serve the public interest.
Further, to do otherwise, will put the Australian Open Government Partnership at risk of a negative review of Australia’s performance on its first NAP because of it will fail the key “ambitious” test and be seen to show a lack of commitment to addressing the OGP key principles.

We submit that this view is reinforced when one has regard also to the list of the Expectations of OGP Participating Governments also contained in the Open Government Partnership: Articles of Governance32:
                    “1. Endorse the high-level Open Government Declaration;
2. Make concrete commitments, as part of a country action plan, that are ambitious and go beyond a country’s current practice;
3. Develop country action plans through a multistakeholder process, with the active
engagement of citizens and civil society;
4. Commit to a self-assessment and independent reporting on the country’s progress; and
5. Contribute to the advancement of open government in other countries through sharing of best practices, expertise, technical assistance, technologies and resources, as appropriate. “

Applying the OGP principles to the grand challenge selection.

As noted above, the present suggestion is that our Australian NAP address two of the five grand challenges –
Improving Public Services33 and
More Effectively Managing Public Resources34.

 We have been unable to identify how Australia’s NAP could be successful in those areas without also addressing at least one or more aspects Grand Challenge 2 – “Increasing Public Integrity”. What it lists are:
“measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom”

Adequately addressing at least corruption, public ethics, access to information and campaign finance reform will be critical for the success of the action proposed, whatever that may be, in the NAP to address each of the two suggested Grand Challenges.

We also bear in mind that in the “OGP National Action Plan Template and Guidelines” (page 3) it is said that

“Successful OGP action plans focus on ambitious national open government priorities and are relevant to the values of transparency and accountability;”

A possible explanation for not including Grand Challenge 2 is that the Government has assumed that it will inevitably be involved, and addressed, and so does not have to be included in the list?

But if that is the case, why not include it?  By not choosing Grand Challenge 2, we would deny Australia the benefit in the ultimate review of its performance of having expressly committed to address three of the grand challenges? If it is not identified as a grand challenge to be addressed, there is also the danger that it will assist anyone involved who might want to keep Grand Challenge 2’s topics out of the discussion or downplay their significance.  We are assuming that that is not the Government’s present intent.

It should also be noted, that the OGP Template envisages that the proposed “Introduction to the NAP” will, among other things, seek to justify the selection of the proposed grand challenges as the ones to be addressed. Our Framework should do likewise.  It is a simple matter to justify the addressing of the three mentioned above because effectively it will identify major areas of government activity plus a commitment to increasing the public integrity of government; for they obviously interlock. It will also facilitate the “vision” statement to be made about the Australian Open Government partnership and so the Government itself.

On the other hand, if Grand Challenge 2 is not included, what will be our justification in the Introduction?

We also need to remember that Australia, for all its problems, is in a position to lead internationally by example and it is in Australia’s international and domestic interests - economic, security, and political - to do so.35

Developing the Framework for the NAP

The government has suggested a structure which includes the following sections – Introduction, Vision, NAP Development Process, Open Government Efforts to Date, Overview of Commitments and Conclusion.

The only comment we make about the structure at this stage is that, having regard to matters that we have raised and discussed in the submission,, some  sections be added and the order perhaps changed as follows – Introduction, NAP Development Process, Open Government Efforts to Date, Guiding principles, Vision, Grand Challenges selected, Overview of Commitments and Conclusion

For reasons already given, we submit there should be a special section which identifies and discusses the principles that have guided the process and the outcome. Done well, it can only assist the implementation of the proposals put forward in the NAP that are made.



A final matter – the reality challenge.
A challenge for the Australian Open Government Partnership is that it ensures that it adequately and accurately identifies the realities in determining what matters need to be addressed and the proposals to be put forward in the NA P.

We submit that there is one reality that the OGP’s objectives and principles require of us Partners to bear in mind throughout the NAP exercise – that, at the Commonwealth level
there is a high risk of corrupt conduct in government at the Commonwealth level, and
.we have a very weak and flawed Government Integrity System, one of the worst in Australia.

Attached as Appendix B is a draft list of the System’s current elements with notes as to their flaws and weaknesses and identification of best practice elsewhere in Australia.

In addition, it needs to be borne in mind that, for some years (and for the foreseeable future), many enterprises large and small have needed government approvals, concessions, tax concessions and other economic supports.  For some years now, we have also been increasingly outsourcing government services, and the services to government, with the result that, many more people are now financially dependent on securing government contracts and negotiating contracts with government. As a result, the opportunity, and so the potential, for corrupt conduct in government has been greatly increased. Further there has been a significant growth over the last 20 to 30 years in the lobbying Industry and in the flow of political donations and at the same time a long standing significant lack of transparency in both those processes.

While on the positive side, whistle-blower protection has been significantly improved, our independent anticorruption body, ACLEI, remains extremely limited in the conduct it can investigate. As a result we remain highly dependent on internal department and agency systems to prevent corrupt conduct and deal with it when it happens. But we know from past experience that that does not work.  In addition, the present policy in the public service in relation to gifts to members of the public service encourages the giving and receipt of gifts;  as noted above, there is also research confirming the effectiveness of small gifts in securing benefits from public servants that would not in the ordinary course be obtained .36


Conclusion.

We trust these responses will assist.

They have been prepared under considerable time pressure. If there are any matters that require supporting material, further development or need clarification or correction we would greatly appreciate the opportunity to address them.

We look forward to participating in this very important task.

Appendix A – “Australia’s Open Government Efforts to Date”37

Australia’s Open Government Efforts to Date
Please note: this content is currently in draft………
Open Reporting, Budgets and Parliamentary Processes
Australia has a long history of public sector and parliamentary open reporting. All government entities are required to produce and publicly publish their annual reports, budgets, contracts and a variety of other reporting requirements for the purposes of oversight and transparency. The recent independent Review of Whole-of-Government Internal Regulation gives a good outline of public sector reporting in the Australian Government. From a Parliamentary perspective, Australia has also had a good track record, with a high level of transparency and reporting across all Parliamentary Business including federal budgets, bills and legislation, transcripts from all Parliamentary business, tabled documents, the work of Parliamentary Committees and much more.
Australia’s original Declaration of Open Government
In 2009, the Gov 2.0 Taskforce was established to advise the Government on the structural barriers and enabling policies for greater information disclosure, digital innovation and online engagement. This included the division of responsibilities for, and overall coordination of, these issues within government. A Declaration of Open Government was launched in 2010 (Archived).
In response, the Government made the Declaration of Open Government and accepted in full the recommendations in the Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for Reform of Australian Government Administration report, both of which promoted greater participation in Australia’s democracy, policy and legislative reform, commitments to open government practices, and greater release of public sector information.
Freedom of Information & Privacy Reforms
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was established in 2010 under the new Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act 1982 was updated making it easier to request information and seek review of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act).
The Information Publication Scheme was (IPS) which implemented directing agencies to take proactive steps to release standard government information in a consistent way reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of the FOI Act.
In 2014 the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) were added to Schedule 1 of the Privacy Act 1988. The APPs regulate the handling of personal information by Australian government and some private sector organisations.
Platforms for Data Release
Data.gov.au was established in 2010 to enable the centralisation and distribution of open data and access to government data APIs. The website was allocated resourcing to initiate whole of government direction and curation of data. In 2012, data.gov.au was allocated resources to strengthen its role as an essential element in Australia’s open government strategy. The number of datasets available on the website has grown from 500 to over 7,000, and is now working in alignment with state and territory and local governments via the Cross Jurisdictional Open Data Working Group to improve open data offerings nationwide.
Adoption of Creative Commons
In order to accommodate greater access to government information and bring consistency in licensing arrangements, the public service adapted Creative Commons Attribution 3.0. The adaption of the license enabled all government content with the exception of Commonwealth Coat of Arms and unless specifically stated elsewhere. Details in the AGD Statement of Intellectual Property Principles for Australian Government.
National Commission of Audit
The National Commission of Audit’s (2014) focus on improving the management of public resources has enabled progressive whole of government changes in a short time. The government has been proactive in addressing the recommendations within the 2014/15 budget and in immediate organisational changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource management.
As part of the structural reforms following the Audit, we have seen amalgamations of key government functions including the creation of the Data Policy Branch within the Department of Communications. This branch is now positioned to provide overall data policy direction on whole of government initiatives including the development and implementation of the Australian Government Open Data policy.
The Audit also recommended further centralisation, sharing, and reuse of government resources with a focus on gaining from the opportunities innovation in technology can provide.
Changes in culture
Open government practices and advances have a dramatic impact on the federal and state and territory public services. The Australian Public Service is learning to value the contribution which more transparent, interactive, and open government practices can offer. It is benefiting from being a workforce which is looking for improvements based on our public needs – not just to solve problems when they arise, it is engaging with the public partnerships to actively encourage private enterprise to provide public services, and it is leveraging the skills and knowledge of the public to improve how it manages its services, manages its data, implements new processes. These changes in culture have been supported by a number of reports in recent years:
Open public sector information: from principles to practice (OAIC). February 2013
Statement of Intellectual Property Principles for Australian Government (AGD). October 2010
Government Response to the Gov 2.0 Taskforce Report (Finance). May 2010
Ahead of the Game – Blueprint for the Reform of Australian Government Administration (PM&C). March 2010 (ARCHIVED)

Foreword by the Australian Government

<<To be inserted>>
Introduction

Australia has a long and proud history of open government. Now, as a digitally literate nation in a rapidly advancing technological environment, it must grasp the opportunity to build on its past efforts. Joining the Open Government Partnership (OGP) is an important step in this direction.

The four key pillars of the OGP – transparency, accountability, participatory democracy and technological innovation – are well-aligned with the principles articulated in Australia’s 2010 Declaration of Open Government:
Informing: strengthening citizen’s rights of access to information, establishing a pro-disclosure culture across Australian Government agencies including through online innovation, and making government information more accessible and usable;
Engaging: collaborating with citizens on policy and service delivery to enhance the processes of government and improve the outcomes sought; and
Participating: making government more consultative and participative.

Why does Open Government matter?
Making government data, information and processes openly available improves public trust, stimulates economic growth, and holds government to account. Additionally, open government can foster fruitful collaboration between the public sector, private organisations and civil society. This kind of engagement facilitates resilience and responsiveness in the face of change, allowing the government to leverage community expertise in pursuit of better outcomes.

What is Australia’s vision for Open Government?
Australia’s National Action Plan will predominantly focus on two of the OGP’s Grand Challenges: “Improving public services” and “More effectively managing public resources.” Australia already has a strong tradition of accountability and public safety, and whilst there is always more work to be done, the opportunities for greatest impact lie in empowering the citizen by streamlining services and managing public resources, particularly through efficient data access.

In accordance with OGP principles, the commitments outlined in the following pages build on our solid foundation of transparency, accountability, participatory democracy and technological innovation. They have been developed alongside key civil society and public stakeholders to ensure their relevance beyond government. Drafted through a process of online and in-person collaboration, this National Action Plan reflects Australia’s ambitious open government agenda for the next two years and beyond.

Overseeing the delivery of the National Action Plan
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will design a mechanism for overseeing the delivery of the 2016 National Action Plan.  This will be established with the cooperation of the civil society organisations and members who participated in the drafting process, along with representatives from Government Agencies involved in the delivery of commitments, and the States/Territories as identified.

Once this group is established, its leadership’s responsibilities will include
Clearly defining further roles and responsibilities, participation and define schedules for meeting and reporting;
Publicising progress on commitments, including all reporting to OGP as necessary;
Co-ordinating the self-assessment process, any Government involvement in the Independent Reporting Mechanism, encouraging participation in Working Groups and developing peer to peer learning opportunities though the OGP;
Designing, executing and reviewing input from future consultation and collaboration processes;
Developing and implementing future National Action Plans, building on the work completed through the 2016 National Action Plan process; and
Promoting the development of Open Government Activities in Australia.

Efforts to date

Australia has a proud history of open government, and has already taken significant strides towards government transparency and civic participation.

Declaration of Open Government
The Australian Government launched a Declaration of Open Government in 2010. It also fully adopted the recommendations of Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for the Reform of Australian Government Administration, a report which emphasised the need to create a more open government.

Open reporting
All Australian Government entities are required to produce and publish their annual reports, budgets, contracts and a variety of other reporting requirements for the purposes of oversight and transparency. The mandate for this is under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.

Similarly, reporting on federal budgets, bills and legislation is published, alongside all Parliamentary transcripts, tabled documents, Committee work, and more.

Freedom of information
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was established in 2010 under the new Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. Over the course of the next four years, the Freedom of Information Act (1982) was updated. These reforms make it easier for the public to request access to information and require agencies to proactively publish information.

The 2010 reforms to the Freedom of Information Act included the introduction of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS) which requires Australian Government agencies subject to the FOI Act to provide a broad range of information on their websites.

Decisions made under the Archives Act (for preserving and conserving the archives of the Commonwealth) have also been impacted, with a resulting reduction in the period of time in which the FOI Act applies for access to Commonwealth documents.  The open access period for Commonwealth records (except for Cabinet notebooks and census information) will be reduced from 30 years to 20 years over a 10 year period commencing from 1 November 2010. 

Whistle-blower protections
Whistle-blower protections in Australia were significantly improved by the 2013 Public Interest Disclosure Act which officially commenced on 15 January 2014. The stated purpose of the Act is to facilitate disclosure and investigation of wrongdoing and maladministration in the Commonwealth public sector, and for other purposes. Under the Act, those who disclose wrongdoing in the public sector can expect that their case will be properly managed, appropriate action will be taken, and that they will receive protection from reprisal and immunity from criminal, civil and administrative liability.

Adoption of Creative Commons
To accommodate access to government information and bring consistency to licensing arrangements, the public service adopted Creative Commons Attribution 3.0.

Public Data Policy Statement
The data held by the Australian Government is a strategic national resource that holds considerable value for growing the economy, improving service delivery and transforming policy outcomes for the Nation.

The Australian Government, in recognising the importance of effectively managing this national resource for the benefit of the Australian people, has committed to optimise the use and reuse of public data; to release non-sensitive data as open by default; and to collaborate with the private and research sectors to extend the value of public data for the benefit of the Australian public.
Public data includes all data collected by government entities for any purposes including; government administration, research or service delivery. Non-sensitive data is anonymised data that does not identify an individual or breach privacy or security requirements.

Data.gov.au
Data.gov.au is an online portal, established in 2010, to centralise access to appropriately anonymised, government data. It facilitates citizen access and reuse of public datasets. In addition to providing access to a catalogue of available datasets, the portal houses a toolkit containing a wide range of resources on open data.

Since its inception, the number of discoverable datasets has grown from approximately 500 to over 7,000.
To deliver the Public Data Statement, Australian Government entities will publish appropriately anonymised government data on or linked through data.gov.au for discoverability and availability.

Among the many public sector datasets now available under open data terms is a national geocoded address file. The open release of this highly sought after file will remove barriers to greater use of the data and unlock and create opportunities for industry innovation and competitiveness.

Digital Transformation Office
The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) was established in July 2015 and is part of the Prime Minister’s portfolio. Its mission is to lead the transformation of government services to deliver a better experience for all Australians.

The DTO itself works as an incubator helping to develop an environment – including the method, culture and talent – that supports rapid service transformation.

To achieve this, the DTO is building digital expertise and capabilities across government agencies, helping to create a world-class public service and a world-leading digital economy.

Its priorities are to deliver projects that demonstrate the best ways to achieve rapid transformation, to improve in-house digital capabilities in government agencies, and establish common platforms to make government more efficient.

Senate Estimates
At least two times each year, estimates of proposed annual expenditure of government agencies are referred by the Senate to eight legislation committees for examination and report. This process ensures transparency and encourages efficiency in government spending. These hearings are documented and available for public consumption.

Anti-Corruption
Active engagement in a range of regional and international forums and initiatives to combat corruption is led by the Attorney-General’s Department.

Australia is a key member of the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group, and led the development of the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan, and the subsequent 2015-16 Anti-Corruption Implementation Plan.

In 2012 Australia's implementation of Chapters III (Criminalisation & Law Enforcement) and IV (International Cooperation) of the United Nations Convention against Corruption was reviewed and found to be fully compliant.

Australia ranked 13th out of 168 countries on Transparency International’s 2015 Corruption Perception Index.



Commitments

<<To be inserted>>

Government Engagement

To ensure that the interests of Australian Government agencies were accommodated in the development of the National Action Plan, an Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) was established. This Committee was chaired by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet with nominated high level officers contributing. The agencies engaged in this process to date, include:

Attorney-General’s Department
Australian Bureau of Statistics
Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
Australian Electoral Commission
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
Australian Public Service Commission
Department of Agriculture and Water Resources
Department of Communications and the Arts
Department of Defence
Department of Education and Training
Department of Employment
Department of the Environment
Department of Finance
Department of Health
Department of Human Services
Department of Immigration and Border Protection
Department of Industry, innovation and Science
Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
Department of Social Services
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
Department of Treasury
Department of Veterans’ Affairs
Digital Transformation Office
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner

In addition, the Parliamentary Departments are being appraised on the progress of the development and delivery of the National Action Plan.

The Inter-Departmental Committee will continue to meet throughout the delivery of the National Action Plan, remaining apprised of the progress, and consider the reports generated under the annual self-assessment process and the Independent Review Mechanism.



Civil Society Engagement

Throughout Australia’s National Action Plan drafting process, the Australian public has been actively engaged through the following mediums:
social media (for example Twitter);
the OGPAu website (ogpau.govspace.gov.au);
in-person events (with live-streaming and online participation enabled where possible);
a ‘wiki’ (which the public can log in and edit);
email and postage contribution; and
civil society, industry and other government jurisdiction led events for contributing to the consultation.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has established a dedicated team, including engagement specialists, to manage the drafting process. This team is responsible for engaging community groups, private sector, government agencies and everyday citizens who have expressed an interest in Open Government or the Grand Challenges to contribute to the plan.

The NAP has been developed in five stages, three of which involved public and civil society engagement.
The National Action Plan has been developed across five stages, three that involve engagement, to ensure we meet the OGP requirements, including the June 2016 deadline:
Stage 1 – Prepare the NAP framework and collect background information (November – December 2015)
Stage 2 – Raise awareness of the initiative, gather commitment suggestions (January – March 2016)
Stage 3 – Prioritise commitments and host a drafting workshop (April 2016)
Stage 4 – Submit the draft NAP for consideration by the Australian Government (May 2016 – June 2016)
Stage 5 – Pending the Australian Government’s decision, aim to launch the National Action Plan (July 2016)

The engagement approach was designed to be open, transparent, and efficient, empowering individuals and organisations to contribute meaningfully.
During stage one, information sessions were held across Australia in December 2015 to inform stakeholders about the National Action Plan.

Stage two focused on encouraging stakeholders to suggestion commitments related to the chosen Grand Challenges.
During this stage, a public wiki was created for the purposes of collaborative drafting. Civil Society and the public were invited to suggest actions directly onto the wiki, where they could also view and comment on existing suggestions. Contributions were initially added to a general commitments page, then categorised into nine themes.

As drafting progressed, the engagement coordinator facilitated introductions between contributors with shared interests. In response to stakeholder interest, a teleconference series was initiated for discussion of themes and commitments among civil society members before the drafting workshop.

As they were identified throughout the process, stakeholders with aligned interests were introduced by email by the engagement coordinator. In response to stakeholder interest, a teleconference series was also used to connect stakeholders and discuss themes among civil society.

Submissions for suggested actions closed on the 31 March 2016, but comments were still welcomed on the wiki. Two follow up teleconferences were also scheduled so that civil society stakeholders could connect before the April workshop. The engagement coordinator provided her contact details so that stakeholders could call or email her directly with questions, at any time.

During Stage three, civil society organisations and members of the public who had proposed an action in Stages One and Two were invited to join government agency representatives at a workshop on proposed commitments. At this event, they also discussed the formation of an implementation committee to oversee the progress of Australia’s first National Action Plan, and discussion of the formation of the group who will oversee the implementation of Australia’s first National Action Plan.

Conclusion

The Australian Government is committed to openness as a basic principle of modern government. The Australian Government’s membership with OGP and this two-year National Action Plan reflects Australia’s drive for improvement in government transparency, accountability, participatory democracy and innovation. In particular, the Australian Government’s commitments focus on improving public services and better managing public resources. The Australian Government’s National Action Plan was developed with civil society, the private sector and the public at large – in order to strengthen open government in Australia.

Theme
1.1 Treasury to share information for maximum public engagement. Reported in the Australian Financial Review on February 22:
Fiscal Transparency
“Treasury will accept more external advice after a review identified economic forecasting flaws that led successive governments
to spend big under the misapprehension of relentlessly strong resources-led growth.”
I have written about Treasury’s poor forecasting previously (here is a visual summary), and I agree with the AFR article: bad
forecasting has led to bad policy.
Much is made of budget transparency, but little is made of forecasting transparency. The assumptions of Treasury should be
open to the public. If Treasury will accept more external advice, it should not keep the information it shares with external parties
confidential. Treasury should share its information openly for maximum public engagement in forecasting, rather than accept the
biases of a few external parties.
Interestingly, the US has included participatory budgeting in its October 2015 OGP commitments. I am not advocating
participatory budgeting, only participatory forecasting.

1.3 Implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Australia.
PIAC recommends that the Commonwealth should publish, and negotiate for all state and territory government agencies to
publish, the aggregate amount paid in legal settlements and ex-gratia payments to non-employees by government agencies in
each financial year. (Recommendation 5)
Establish a publicly available register of the beneficial ownership of companies.
This is a commitment in the UK National Action Plan 2013 to 2015. This would build on the current ASIC company registry, but
would require the disclosure of beneficial owners, people who directly or indirectly own or control a company. It would need to be
an offence for a person to register a company and not disclose the beneficial owners and an offence for a person to be a
beneficial owner and not to have disclosed that fact. Shell companies with hidden ownership are used in a variety of
transnational crimes, from tax evasion, to money laundering, to bribery to the financing of terrorism. The current ASIC database
does not require the disclosure of beneficial owners, which has allowed front people to be used to hide the real owners of
businesses involved in criminal activity. The UK Government revealed that 6,150 people currently act as directors of more than
20 UK registered companies, with some people being directors in over 1,000 companies. A research report by World-Check had
previously shown that almost 4,000 people who are appear on various international watch lists are registered as directors of UK
companies.
This included 154 people allegedly involved in financial crime, 13 individuals wanted by Interpol for alleged terrorist activities and
37 accused of involvement in the drugs trade. No such data has ever been publicly disclosed for companies registered in
Australia.

Research by Findley, Nielson and Sharman also found Australian corporate service providers were near the top of corporate
service providers in terms of being willing to set up an untraceable shell company even when there was significant risk the
company in question would be used for illicit purposes.
The World Bank and UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) published a report reviewing some 150 cases of corruption where
the money from laundered. In the majority of cases:
•A corporate vehicle was misused to hide the money trail;
•The corporate vehicle in question was a company or corporation;
•The proceeds and instruments of corruption consisted of funds in a bank account; and
•In cases where the ownership information was available, the corporate vehicle in question was established or managed by a
professional intermediary.
In two-thirds of the cases some form of surrogate, in ownership or management, was used to increase the opacity of the
arrangement.In half the cases where a company was used to hide the proceeds of corruption, the company was a shell
company.One in seven of the companies misused were operational companies, that is ‘front companies’.

In 2015 the Australian Government endorsed the G20 High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency (see

commitment might be monitored.
High level summary of today's discussion. There were 9 people on the call: Andrew, Ashok, Cameron, Chandi (no microphone), Fiscal Transparency
Kevin, Rosie, Mark, Dez and myself. Within this theme 5 categories of actions were discussed: 1) Transparent forecasting of
budgets - revenue modelling and spending; 2) Campaign finance; 3) Ownership of companies; 4) Transparency of procurement
and grants; 5) Performance indicators and reporting of program spending. I encouraged participants to connect their suggestions
to the two Grand Challenges set by the Government and consider how they might be delivered as an OGP commitment. The
OGP NAP template was shared as a guide. We also discussed the need for agencies will need to take on responsibility as lead
agency for the delivery of actions and the need to cluster actions if we are to narrow them down to 5-15 commitments for the
NAP. Some participants will now add their actions to other them to other theme areas to reflect connections to Grand Challenges
and other actions suggested. A general overview of the event on the 11th April was provided including how actions outside the
Grand Challenges would be dealt with - i.e. commitment templates would be developed and actions could still be pursued but
they are unlikely to be included in the NAP. The question of budgets for delivery of OGPAU commitments was raised and budget
cycles were discussed. Ongoing engagement among participants was encouraged - participants will comment on this wiki and
consent was provided to share emails among the group. A follow up call for this theme will also be scheduled for next week.

1.6 Fiscal Transparency
Greater transparency in public procurement: Governments should publish in a timely manner the selection criteria and
the method of award of any contract before the procurement process commences; Governments should collect and disclose the
identity and beneficial ownership of all bidders;
Full details of awarded contracts should be disclosed and the details of completion of the contract should be published in a timely
manner with any alterations to the terms of the original contract also disclosed; Independent monitoring of all stages of the
procurement process with a robust, transparent and effective appeals process should be accessible; Information on public
procurement should be available in open data format – non-proprietary, searchable, sortable, platform-independent and machine-
readable. Note: This needs more detail to be an actionable item. Have asked for more specific details from the proposer.(note

open data grants administered by all Commonwealth agencies and is supposed to come online over the coming year. Currently
grants are published in a variety of formats (html, pdf, csv, excel) and the Guideline 412 applying to grant reporting is interpreted
differently from one agency to another which makes the data difficult to work with. Some quality issues such as DSS grants
providing only location of head office as opposed to the location where money is spent have been highlighted as a persistent
issue in the ANAO Report Delivery and Administration of Grant Programmes published on 15 March 2016

Participatory budgeting Participatory budgeting relies on deliberation for its success. I.e. "Voting" (if required) is the end stage of Fiscal Transparency
a long process which draws people into exchanging views, values and ideas, better understanding each other and leading to
better developed policy, which may be agreed by consensus. There is now a wealth of experience of how to make this work well
and flaws to avoid.
A good starting point would be to require Federal MPs to use participatory budgeting techniques to decide on projects to be
funded under the "Stronger Communities Programme" ($150,000 per MP)
My views on participatory budgeting is that it needs to be prefaced by budget transparency. There is a great deal of obfuscation Fiscal Transparency
in public debate regarding government spending which can be addressed through supporting budget transparency projects both
technically and financially. These projects require open budget data and also information regarding how funding flows to the
states and local government. Comprehensive and accurate budget transparency projects need to be based on detailed
understanding of the inner workings of how government administers funding, the kinds of questions that are not always
addressed in public facing documents. I'm starting a list of these on GitHub for developers working on budget apps at
https://github.com/forkinthecode/Budget-Transparency If you know the answers to the current questions - I'm all ears!
Breaking participatory budgeting down to specific programs is one way to avoid dealing with the bigger questions of where
money is going overall geographically & politically however these are very important questions that attract the interest of the
public, NGO's, media & government alike.
The Commonwealth has done a good job with federal budget data both in opening it and receiving ongoing feedback as to how it
can be improved however there is no infrastructure in Australia to fund these kinds of civic-lead projects that to be done properly
require significant input of expertise, labour and public engagement. Such projects are not traditionally business oriented so
unlikely to attract the interest of startup venture capitalists but the value of better analysis of spending patterns can not be
overlooked.1.9 Improved reporting of expenditure, major projects and departmental reporting
1) Regular publishing of government expenditure
records down to $1000. Currently federal government contracts over $10k
are reported in Australia through the AusTender website and
ondata.gov.au however, there are a lot of expenses below $10k that
arguably would be useful to know. In the UK they introduced expenditure
reporting per department monthly at https://data.gov.uk/data/openspending-report/index
2) A public register of all gov funded major projects (all types) along
with status, project manager and regular reporting. This would make it
easier to track major projects and to intervene when they are not
delivering.
3) Update of PBS and Annual Report templates for comparative budget and
program information with common key performance indicators and reporting
for programs and departmental functions. Right now agencies do their
reporting in PDF documents that provide no easy way to compare outcomes,
programs, expenditure, etc. If common XML templates were used for
common reports, comparative assessment would be easier and information
about government as a whole much more available for assessment.

1.10 Fiscal Transparency
Governments don't know how to buy free software. Despite open government policies highlighting benefits of open source
software and open standards, government uptake
of open source is surprisingly low. Why? Because government purchasing practices inadvertently favour proprietary software
and vendor lock-in tactics over collaborative business practices used by open communities. There are multiple aspects to this,
which should be understood, leading to updated guidelines to government purchasing practices. Some considerations include:
How to compare long term value of open source and proprietary business models. How to assess the health of an open source
community and associated rate of innovation in order to properly assess the value of open source.How to assess a product's
claims of standards compliance. Some companies dissuade standards use by pricing extra for standards use, or limiting
standards based functionality.How to assess the quality and applicability of a standard, and whether to invest in influencing the
development of the standard.Typically government officials have mandate to solve department-wide problems, however open
source and open standards based solutions will often be best justified at a Whole-Of-Government, or Whole-Of-World level. One
particular argument is "If I invest in an open standard, or open source, I will see minimal immediate benefit, but long term will see
international adoption which will lead to advancement of my local goals."Government's asymmetric spending of discretionary
budgets at year-end disadvantages fee-for-service business models typically employed by open source businesses.
1.11 The Australian Government should endorse the principles of open contracting. In doing so Australia will build on the existing
foundation of transparency in procurement and contracting and, in consultation with civil society organisations and other
stakeholders, Australia should look at ways to enhance the scope, breadth and usability of published contractual data."

And as a complimentary measure, the Australian government will promote the principles of transparency and accountability in all
government-funded construction projects in the domestic and international arenas, including, in the period up until 2018, working
with others in government (eg Infrastructure Australia and in state counterparts) and civil society to identify suitable projects for
the application of the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST) in Australia, and using its bilateral and multilateral
relationships to encourage the establishment of at least four new national CoST programmes in countries where DFAT is
working. The Australian Government will continue to play a role in transforming the transparency of global development
assistance by publishing information on official development assistance (ODA) in line with the International Aid Transparency
Initiative (IATI) Standard, so that Australian assistance can be tracked through the delivery chain. In the 2014 Aid Transparency
Index (http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2014-ati/ ) Australia's performance was rated to be Fair. It would be a great step
forward to aim to improve that rating to the Very Good category as a measy

1.3
My apology for the 'typo' I suggest that an aspiration for Australia's aid transparency to be assessed as in the Very Good
Category might be a measure of Australia's increased aid transparency.
The government has been incrementally improving its public reporting. The Federal Budget papers and supporting are now
made one the same evening or soon after thanks to the efforts of data.gov.au, and the ATO is publishing an extract of tax
statistics several years after the year in question.
With regard to the expenditure reporting, the lack of standardisation of programme naming schemes, and machinery of
government changes, makes it rather difficult to track expenditure across financial years. This is largely because it is reported at
an aggregate level in the budget papers. Seeing as agencies have to track at a finer level of detail for the purposes of running
the programmes themselves, they would have the information within their individual financial management information systems.
All of this information would be passed between agencies as part of any Machinery of Government change, so the information is
not lost. Perhaps as well as the budget papers, if agencies could report (at least at an aggregate / programme level) the level of
expenditure (Capex and Opex) for each programme we would attain greater visibility to how each agency is delivering the
programme.
On the revenue side, the ATO captures all of the information, and seems to have internal processes to filter the data to protect
the privacy of individuals prior to publication. It would be beneficial if that information on taxation revenue was available to the
public sooner. In a perfect world, published at the same time as Final Budget Outcome (FBO). This would provide people with (at
a year level) a view to detail as to government expenditure, and the revenue (or debt) that was taken on to achieve the outcomes
from that expenditure.

Open up the procurement process to facilitate greater participation and public sector innovation
Fostering Innovation
There's scope here to link the Government's OGP commitments to a new initiative in its National Innovation and Science
Agenda, which states: “We will challenge small to medium enterprises to deliver innovative solutions for government, rather than
tendering for an existing product.”
Opening up the procurement process in this way -- over and above mere transparency – will facilitate greater participation and
public sector innovation. It requires a commitment to an open innovation model, replacing or expanding existing tendering
systems with open innovation platforms. A culture of openness early in policy program development is needed; current
procurement focuses on outputs rather than outcomes, with little early external participation to validate the appropriateness of
the outputs.
Innovation Australia's 2014 submission to the Inquiry into Commonwealth Procurement Procedures articulated it this way:
"Agencies contemplating tenders should be required to give adequate notice of their intentions and take submissions regarding
innovative possibilities."

technologies to pursue Society Growth ( wisdom.to/pledge ) . Secondly, the Australian Government could consider a Network
Democracy platform which restores the balance with real-time, comprehensive citizen participation across government,
democracy and industry" ( wisdom.to/networkdemocracy ). Network Democracy could provide transparent participation and
collaboration across every government department and agency. Thirdly, Health Wisdom could provide nationwide collaboration
between doctors, patients, nurses and other caregivers ( wisdom.to/health ). This could evolve in the Australia Wisdom Network
which crowd creates Network Society ( wisdom.to/australia ).
Encourage and enable the delivery unsolicited proposals if they are in the public interest
Fostering Innovation
Establish an open and transparent process to encourage unsolicited proposals from the public, business and industry. This
would enable all levels of business to contribute not only ideas but infrastructure, services, and alternative business models to
support the delivery of public services and infrastructure. The process could be made more open and efficient by: 1) creating an
online platform to crowd source and encourage proposal pitching; 2) inviting public participation through a representative sample
of the population who would be able to develop a criteria for evaluation and / or consider the proposals on an occasional basis /
biannually or quarterly through a deliberative process that considers context, impacts, requirements to deliver and weighs up
pros and cons of various options suggested. 3) A format or basic criteria for proposals and pitches so the public know what they
can expect and proposals are well formed for consideration. 4) An internal taskforce to coordinate (and communicate)
Government processes to enables the delivery of these proposals including transparent approval process, allocation of funding
and other support mechanisms provided. This process could start small as a pilot with a stated quantity of funds and public
resources allocated to invite and encourage proposals and a criteria establish to evaluate them.
Procuring innovation. To genuinely innovate the Federal Government should establish processes that enable collaboration inside Fostering Innovation
and outside of the public sector, especially when problems are complex and input is required from non-government
organisations to test understanding and explore potential impacts. To enable collaboration in these matters Government need to
be able to procure services to co-design, prototype and test solutions when outcomes can not be known, and those involved
need to provide fluid services. The responsive nature of this type of services design and solving problem makes it almost
impossible for Government and its service providers to define exactly what will be required when the project commences. While
it is commonly understood that this type of responsive service and collaboration is required, it is not currently possible to procure
these types of services within traditional procurement models.
Increasingly, and especially in the context of start-ups, small and agile innovators and innovative companies, Government need
to be able to procure innovators, not innovations. The ability to more rapidly identify players - people and organisations - who not
only ‘get it’ but have even a remote chance of 'getting it done’ in areas where new ideas, different approaches and genuine
innovation is being sought is itself a key challenge. Agencies need scope to find and engage individuals whose experience,
insights and approach make them ideal partners forexploration phases, and when continuing and evolving innovation.
Government also should consider supporting people and the organisations they need to involve when co-designing, prototyping
and testing ideas and approaches. The current focus on procurement process, especially when innovative outcomes are being
sought, can itself generate adverse outcomes in terms of efficiency, fairness and productivity. Asking people and organisations
good at the new dynamic of design, rapid testing of multiple prototypes and eventual scaling of successful solutions, to bend
their skills to participate in slower more cumbersome, complex and time consuming procurement processes is limiting the scope
of providers and creative options available to Government.
Perhaps there could be a different space seyt up adjacent to the more formal procurement process with clear expectations set
(and adhered to) about the ability to play in the larger and more formal procurement processes when it comes time to buy a
solution at scale.This additional space would provide for the necessary legibility of process (who is involved, on what terms etc)
while at the same time providing for more flexible and less onerous process provisions to nurture faster, more open and iterative
conversations and exchanges.
2.4.1
I agree with this suggestion.
Fostering Innovation
The following is an expansion on the ideas and a possible action item for OGPAU.
It is difficult to introduce innovation into government or any large organization. Christensen described it in "The Innovator’s
Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail". What is true for commercial organizations is relevant to
governments.
The best chance of government innovation is to leave existing systems as they are. Instead of trying to change existing systems
keep innovation outside existing systems. But have ways to allow innovations to connect to existing systems. Existing systems
can then evolve. The way we connect systems is the key to innovation adoption.
Innovation requires the participation of organizations who have the responsibility for "business as usual". They need to co-create
the innovations with an eye to integration if successful. This co-creation should also involve the parties who are the beneficiaries
of government services.
A dampener on innovation is the political process. Innovation requires a by-partisan approach. Keeping innovation out of the
political process benefits all. Innovation and change is an ongoing process not a once off. It goes beyond the electoral cycle.
Arranged well all parties can share in the credit and take no blame.
Within these constraints we can structure a process for innovation. A possible process may be along the following lines.
An innovation must be demonstrable "in the small". It must be something that will work with a few participants. This is Minimum
Viable Product idea.
An innovation must integrate with existing systems without changing existing systems. This means systems are autonomous.
Neither depends on the other.
An innovation is co-created. Possible participants are the proposers, agencies and the beneficiaries of the services.
An innovation must be able to show how it adds value to the community. Value extends beyond monetary measures. When
realised the monetary value is available to fund future innovations.

Enabling place based reform through cross sector collaboration
Fostering Innovation
The Federal Government should lead the collation of place-based data – both activity and outcome data – and support localised
sense making.Open data that builds understanding of the outcomes of citizens will create the enabling conditions for place
based reform.However, open data in itself is not enough.Data needs to be shared in ways that are useable and easily
consumable - preferably in visual form.And further, the Federal Government needs to play a role in supporting sense making
through analysis and dialog.Place based reform is dependant on inputs and processes that build a shared understanding of
complex problems and shared approaches to making large scale social change.
Two live examples of the need for open data, that is citizen centred and visual is Maranguka's Justice Reinvestment Initiative for
Bourke and Empowered Communities.PM&C is involved in both the emerging initiatives.
Place based reform process will improve the delivery and cost-effectiveness of public services.Localised change agendas -
developed by all sectors - will guide the design and delivery of public services so they better meet local priorities, are more
flexible and responsive, and are less duplicative and fragmented.priorities, such as child development, poverty reduction, crime

I can't see this Commitment idea in any of the themes so I'm adding it here: An open data/open government Cooperative
Research Centre would provide the infrastructure and research commitment required to make use of open data in the Australian
context for policy, business and research purposes. It would also hook up the government's Innovation program with the open
government agenda.
Innovations of their nature are difficult to procure as they are unknown. Innovations can be procured by procuring experiments. Fostering Innovation
The procurement process assumes the government knows what it is buying.If it is an innovation then it is unknown. Buying or
promoting the unknown is risky.
One way to introduce innovations is to do it as a co-creation activity in isolation and as an experiment.The experimental method
looks for failure.If the experiment fails that is a success.If the experiment does not fail the innovation is a success.
We have an innovation to open personal data to the person.It could be used for a co-creation experiment.
Commitment : Reform the procurement process making it easier for people and businesses to work with, and collaborate with
government.
Fostering Innovation
The closed nature of the existing procurement panel process to get on a government supplier list, is an obstacle for government
agencies being able to innovate, and find new service providers and SMEs to work with or collaborate with.
2.10
The existing categories use old terminology and do not reflect contemporary roles and services. The government should open
the lists and create new service categories to enable fresh people, ideas, approaches, and techniques.
Addresses : Fostering Innovation, Access to Information, Public Participation, Improve Public Service Improvement and Delivery Fostering Innovation
Commitment : Review the Australian Intellectual Property Rules with public and private sector participation. Create and publish
useful, open and educational information for government staff, and service providers and citizens about where rules apply and
where there are exceptions, particularly in relation to procurement.
Context :
The Australian Government position on IP can be confusing, is at times contradictory and can be easily misunderstood by
internal government staff as well as external service providers.
Across agencies and all levels of government across the nation different rules apply. There is a lack of consistency, transparency
and explanation as to why there are different stances with regard to IP and copyright.
For example - the default position for the Australian Government and NSW Government is that ICT providers and SMEs to retain
their IP in order to benefit from their ideas and foster innovation. However, this seems to change between agencies and
jurisdictions. It would be enormously helpful to provide clarity around IP and copyright to make it easier to do business with and
collaborate with government.
Suggestion:
It is the opportune time review this, provide frameworks and scenarios of best practices to complement the launch of the National
Innovation and Science Agenda.
This will help drive government and private sector innovation, encourage collaboration with government, researchers and
universities.
To help foster content innovation, a review of how Crown copyright is used and applicable, and a move to a creative commons
licensing frameworks is required. Content should be able to be openly shared and reused, and where appropriate distributed
through multiple channels to reach the broadest possible audience.
2.11
2.12
2.13
This will encourage the uptake of creative commons, as well as provide opportunities to create an ecosystem of content
innovators and the creation of original local content in collaboration with agencies and other organisations such as museums.
It would be great to be able to have groups of students involved in the innovation process around open data with government
agencies. They will provide a valuable perspective, as digital natives, future users and employees of government agencies.
Fostering Innovation
Many agencies of a reasonable size have an internal software development capability. These intrepid souls cut the code to build Fostering Innovation
and maintain software capability to deliver agency outcomes. In some cases these solutions are delivered to citizens with the
high transaction variety now fall within the Digital Transformation Office remit.
To support Open Government, perhaps start small and encourage Agencies to share code amongst themselves as a stepping
stone to open the software to citizens. Agencies could publish their internally developed code (production versions) to a central
repository that could be indexed and searched by other agencies. Perhaps an Agency only version of the GitHub used by the
DTO? This would help promote reuse within Agencies and allow the public service and its agents with a broader mechanism to
solve challenges. Perhaps with such a mechanism once software is considered mature enough it is published externally so it can
be made "Open" to the community at large.
Innovation requires the right environment. Innovative ideas that eventually turn into successful products, services or processes
Fostering Innovation
are rewarded in the private sector. However, in the public sector, it is usually a pat on the back- there is seldom any reward. If an
idea fails in the public sector, the consequences are negative for everyone in that chain of command: negative press coverage,
complaints from the public, questions about sensible resource utilisation... You can imagine the headlines in the newspaper!
In a society that punishes failures disproportionately compared to rewards given to winners, innovation will remain stagnant. Let
us call this the external innovation culture since it is external to the group that is trying to innovate.
The fear and reluctance for trying out new ideas is compounded in an environment where there is no profit motive. In an
environment where status-quo is the norm, and management does not like to go out of its comfort zone, established norms or
ways of doing things is not questioned, and anyone who does so is ignored, frowned upon or gently cast aside. I call this the
internal innovation culture. This internal culture has to change to make governments more innovative, transparent and efficient.
Solutions
Changing the External Innovation Culture
Political consensus will greatly help soften external culture. If the major political parties are agreed upon trying out, for example,
20 new ideas at CentreLink, the risk of criticism towards the ruling government and department head would greatly be reduced
even if half of them fail. If such a consensus is arrived at, accompanied by enthusiastic participation from civil society or groups,
then the risk of negative media coverage will also be reduced. The overall winner would be an innovative public services.
Changing the Internal Innovation Culture
Hiring workers from outside the APS into all levels of the APS, particularly the higher EL1, EL2 and SES levels will infuse a new
way of thinking. This can be done, for example, by including prominent players from the private sector in hiring panels of SES
jobs. This will infuse new blood into the APS. Once we have people within the APS who think outside the box, who do not
hesitate to be different and act different, they will innovate (or at least encourage and allow innovation by others). They will be
less risk averse and more tolerant towards failures. They will provide innovative solutions to customers without customers having
to come up with new ideas. The current system of a public service that is desensitised to public needs will change over time.
Changing the internal and external innovation cultures will help citizens be served better, reduce corruption and lead to
adaptation of new technologies and methods, thereby lead to a strong participatory democracy and improve transparency, This
will in turn improve innovativeness. Innovation begets innovation!
2.14
2.15
Rather than focus on innovation, reward and promote solutions in local communities and public service delivery. Develop simple Fostering Innovation
payment models that pay 5-10% of savings. Innovation is about investment in outcomes not investment in innovation as an
activity.
Innovations of their nature are difficult to procure as they are unknown. Innovations can be procured by procuring experiments. Fostering Innovation
The procurement process assumes the government knows what it is buying. If it is an innovation then it is unknown. Buying or
promoting the unknown is risky.
One way to introduce innovations is to do it as a co-creation activity in isolation and as an experiment. The experimental method
looks for failure. If the experiment fails that is a success. If the experiment does not fail the innovation is a success.

Fostering Innovation3.1 Practical aspects of using and maintaining information. Australia has an open by default policy for government data. A great first Freedom of Information
step, but of minimal value until the data is readily usable. Yes, a bus timetable is useful when a paper copy of it is distributed to
commuters every 6 months. But it is super useful when bus timetables are integrated with real-time bus and traffic data travel
plans can be adjusted accordingly. This is facilitated by the concept of "mashable government" where government data is made
available in machine readable form via standards based Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). Cross agency integration of
datasets can open up significant value, but usually requires addressing of technical, financial, legal and social challenges.
Agencies need to agree upon common formats for common datasets (typically through use open standards). Who benefits from
aggregated datasets is usually different to those who collects and maintains the data. As such, solving integration issues often
requires creative, cross-agency, business cases to be crafted.The National Action Plan should discuss: Mashable Government,
APIs, use/extend/create open standards (in that order), writing business cases to identify high value datasets, and cross-agency
funding of data management strategies.
3.1.1 Agree. Usability of open or shared data remains one of the biggest challenges. Until this challenge is addressed open data
Freedom of Information
cannot possibly deliver outcomes near to the prospectus of promise it was sold on.
Absolutely - This is an important part of PiaWaugh submission Mandated open Application Programmable Interfaces (APIs) for Freedom of Information

across all departments consistently for responding to requests. Currently doing an FOI request can be tricky to figure out (unless
you can find community initiatives like righttoknow which has automated the process externally) and the approach to FOI
requests varies quite dramatically across departments. A single official way to submit requests, track them, and see reports
published, as well as a single mechanism to respond to requests would be better for the citizen experience and far more efficient
for government. (Full blog post on my personal submission at http://pipka.org/2016/03/28/my-personal-ogpau-submission/)

Review of Australia's access to information law and practice
Commitment: To undertakea review of the Freedom of Information Act and its implementation by agencies and ministers by a
panel of experts drawn from government and civil society to report
within 6 months on ways to improve and enhance Australian law and practice in accordance with widely accepted best practice
standards in this country and internationally.
Freedom of Information
Rationale: Access to government information, guaranteed by law, is a cornerstone of democracy. As former Australian
Information Commissioner Professor John McMillan said recently (http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/commitment-to-
freedom-of-information-bolsters-our-democracy/news-story/a76fe5aa312e04ff728d4fe9b80bd09a)
"The FoI Act ushered in a new era of open government in 1982. Ever since, government in Australia has been more responsive,
engaged and transparent. The Australian lead was followed in many other countries. And yes, the FoI Act is not perfect. It
doesn’t balance well the administrative demands on government with the ideal of public access to government information. Many
recommendations for reform have been made during the past five years by the OAIC and others. There has been scant
government consideration of those proposals, at least outside the bunker.There is an urgent need for constructive debate on
future directions in FoI. No political party can truly claim to subscribe to a policy of open government while this impasse
continues."
A wide range of experts outside government have serious concerns about the current state of the law and the practices adopted
in many government agencies. The development of the national action plan provides the opportunity for discussion and debate
about much needed reform.
The Centre for Law and Democracy (Canada) rated the Federal FOI act 51 of 104 right to information laws reviewed, awarding
83 points out of a possible 150. Since that assessment the Government announced its intention to abolish the Office of
Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). If the bill, still before the Senate, passed into law a further drop in international
standing would follow.
Serious consideration of other reforms will be constrained while the Government maintains its position that the OAIC should be
abolished and in the meantime that funding for the office notextend to the full range of its functions.
3.4
3.5
Recommendations put forward but not discussed “outside the bunker” to use Professor McMillan’s words, include those
contained in the Australian Law Reform Commission 2009 report Secrecy Laws and Open Government; the report by Dr Allan
Australia's independent watchdog and advocate for open government. As a number of others have proposed the Government
Freedom of Information
should withdraw the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill which has been before the Senate since
October 2014 and not brought on for a vote because it does not enjoy majority support. In the meantime reduced funding for the
OAIC has meant the office does not carry out some functions conferred on it by Parliament and has a limited capacity to carry
out others. As Dr Lidberg's research identifies, cultural change in the direction of openness and transparency is more important
in achieving the objectives that underpin freedom of information than changes to the law, but clearly culture and a modern well
balanced law that reflects Australian and international good practice are both important. Australia cannot credibly support the
OGP and explore reforms on the home front to advance transparent open government and increased citizen participation while
planning to abolish the office of information commissioner, the body established by parliament to play a key role in advancing
those same objectives.
Amendmends to FOI laws- Based on the article and my other research (2001-2016) here are my recommendations re
Freedom of Information
information access in Australia’s OGP national plan in dot points.
•Culture change of the administration of FOI is more important than legal reform and change. Put more effort into FOI guidelines
issued fromministers and heads of department – see the WA example in the article. These guidelines should make it clear that
the task of public servants is to facilitate FOI requests and that a fast as possible processing time should be a priority.
•Re-fund the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Re-appoint the Information Commissioner and FOI
Commissioner.
•Aim to change the current ‘pull’ information culture to a ‘push’ one. All information should be considered public and the public
servantsshould have to justify why a generated document should not be public.
Legal reforms:
•Amend FOI laws to include a FOI/Information Commissioner in all Australian jurisdictions modelled on the OAIC
•Implement the FOI disclosure logs across all FOI jurisdictions and task the FOI/Info commissioner with following up the
implementation and use of the disclosure logs. ALL
•Scrap the $30 FOI request fee – it sends the wrong signals.
•Introduce a public interest request category – if the request qualifies in this category – processing fees should not be charged.
The default should be not to charge fees.
•Amend the FOI laws in all Australian jurisdictions to include all government agencies modelled on best practice legislations in
countries like Sweden and the US where no government agencies are exempt. Exempting agencies signals secrecy instead of
transparency. Documents from security agencies may be redacted, but it is an important step in changing the administrative
culture from secrecy to openness.
3.6
Transparency on customs data. Follow the example of other countries, such as the US and India, and make customs data
publicly available, so that government is not hiding where companies are sourcing products from. Making key data about
imported products publicly available would allow greater ability to detect where Australian importers are dealing with suppliers
where there is the presence of criminal activity, human rights abuses and/or unlawful environmental destruction and the source
jurisdiction has failed to take effective action to stop the criminal abuse. This would have a deterrent impact on the risks
Australian importers are willing to take in dealing with suppliers where there is significant risk of criminal activity and human
rights abuses being present, out of concern of reputational risk.
Freedom of Information
Currently information about imports is recorded through the Australian Government’s Integrated Cargo System (ICS) and
includes the type of product, quantity, the supplier and the recipient. In other jurisdictions, including the United States, the EU
and India, this data is made publicly available. However, import data collected through Australia’s ICS is not made public. Limited
statistical data from ICS is made available to the Australian Bureau of Statics for research purposes.
In the jurisdictions where customs data is publicly available there is no evidence of any significant impact on commercial
activities or the proper functioning of markets. There is evidence that it has assisted importers in those jurisdictions to be made
aware of risks of human rights abuses and criminal activity in relation to suppliers they are sourcing from.
3.7
Strengthen FOI Freedom of Information
Freedom of Information
1. Reverse the proposed changes to the OAIC regime by withdrawing legislation to abolish the Office, re-instating funding to the
level
necessary for it to be able to fulfilits freedom of information, privacy, and information policy functions , and ensuring the prompt
appointment of a new Australian Information Commissioner and Freedom of Information Commissioner.
2.Establish a comprehensive review of the FOI Act, as proposed by the 2013 Hawke Review (rec 1).
3.Add to the list of items suggested by Hawke for consideration a.the addition of public interest tests to other exemptions such as
the exemptions for trade secrets etc and breach of confidence; b.the removal of exclusions for specific bodies, including national
security agencies and parliamentary departments; and c.the implementation of further measures to improve the transparency of
government procurement processes and government contracts.3.8
Ensure better Freedom of Information. Societies are not served by secretive governments and indeed democracies are better
for opening up the processes that form policy and theadministrative framework of government, both parliament and the public
service.
Freedom of Information
Actionable 1: Remove the Bill to abolish the OAIC. Fund the OAIC to ensure proper resources to fulfil role to a high level and to
avoid backlogs.
Actionable 2:Improve data publishing including publishing ministerial and briefings as a matter of course to allow public
participation in the formation of policy.A working group might ascertain the appropriate time period before publication.
Actionable 3:Look at removing all agency exemptions to the FOI Act including parliamentary departments and national security
agencies.There are existing exemptions that agencies might utilise in weighing up FOI applications for information, especially
around national security.
Actionable 4:Implement workshops within the public service to ensure that staff are aware of agency obligations under the FOI
Act in the same way that mandatory security awareness workshops are managed.
Actionable 5:Centralise the FOI disclosure logs to one site with each agency can access using their own password for uploading
documents.A user-friendly search function using keywords would harness documents from a number of different agencies on a
particular topic. This would aid in academic research as well as expanding information available for citizens to make informed
choices.It also would reduce pressure on FOI if information is easily sourced.
Actionable 6:Include private contractors in the FOI Act to ensure proper scrutiny of the use of public monies. Transferring the
same standards of governance, accountability and transparency to businesses that perform government functions is a
fundamental aspect of democracy.
3.9 Amend the FOI act Amend the Commonwealth FOI Act to make the section 47 exemption (trade secrets or commercially
valuable information) subject
to the public interest test, at least where s 47(3) applies (i.e. government-held trade secrets or commercially valuable
information.
3.10 Introduction fo a fair use exception to copyright law. Australia's Copyright legislation creates many problems for libraries, cultural Freedom of Information
and education institutions to manage and reuse government resources. The review conducted by the ALRC on 'Copyright and
the digital economy' addressed many issues and its recommendations would go a long way to improving access and use of
government information.
Freedom of Information
The ALRC was asked to consider whether the current exceptions and statutory licences in the Copyright Act are adequate and
appropriate in the digital era. The Report, tabled on 13 February 2014, is the result of an 18-month Inquiry during which the
ALRC produced two consultation documents, undertook 109 consultations and received 870 submissions. The Report contains
30 recommendations for reform. The key recommendation is for the introduction of a fair use exception to Australian copyright
law.
3.11
At present government agencies ask people for information that the agencies then check. Instead allow people to confirm
information about themselves before passing it on to agencies.

Freedom of Information
However, it should be noted that 90% of all FOI request are for personal information held by organizations. Accordingly this
proposal has been moved to public service delivery because it is about improving the efficiency. It could possibly fund FOI
requests of all types from the savings made on personal information FOI.
Encourage government agencies to follow Privacy Principle 12. In particular 12.4(b)."give access to the information in the
manner requested by the individual, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so".
Freedom of Information
Reinstate the OAIC by withdrawing legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, re-instating
Freedom of Information
funding for the OAIC to fulfil its mandate in relation to
freedom of information, privacy, and information policy, and ensuring the prompt appointment of a new Australian Information
Commissioner with full powers.
Establish a review of the operation of the OAIC to commence at the start of 2017 and to cover the period from its creation in
Freedom of Information
2010 to the end of 2016.
My suggestion is that most Cabinet papers be released within weeks of Cabinet decisions, excluding those documents relating to Freedom of Information
security, defence or international relations. The 20 year rule is unnecessary for the majority of Cabinet documents. Where
Cabinet papers touch on commercial-in-confidence matters, then a process of redaction will be necessary.
Timely release of Cabinet documents will help forge a community consensus on difficult but necessary reforms/decisions by
disclosing all information used to make those decisions. Over time it will also promote a culture of evidence-based policy
development.
Where a Cabinet decision does not follow bureaucratic advice and underlying evidence, then this is clear to the community, and
it is then up to the Cabinet to publicly justify that departure.
It is desirable that a Federal Cabinet be free to make decisions against bureaucratic advice (e.g. to fulfill an election promise),
but the community will benefit from knowing where and when then these differences arise and the basis on which advice
bureaucratic advice was not taken.

I’ve pasted the abstract, discussion and conclusion from a research article that will be published in the July edition of the
Australian Journalism Review. The article is under copyright, so I can’t paste the full paper here – but the abstract and
discussion and conclusions provides the core of the findings and argument. The article will be available in full from July 2016.
The points below also applies to some of the actions needed in the Open Data section,
Based on the article and my other research (2001-2016) here are my recommendations re information access in Australia’s OGP
national plan in dot points.
• Culture change of the administration of FOI is more important than legal reform and change. Put more effort into FOI guidelines

Metrics to assess utilisation of information access rights: State and Territory Information Commissioners/Officers/Ombudsmen
responsible for upholding, reviewing and determining information access rights have agreed to collectively contribute to the
development of a set of metrics to assess public utilisation of information access rights in Australia. These measures may
include:
Freedom of Information
Applicant by type
Application rates per capita
Reviews as a % of application numbers
Release rates
Refusal rates
The development and collection of data to inform an assessment of the utilisation of information access rights within Australian
States and Territories is unprecedented. The metrics will assist in building a more complete picture of open government, with a
focus on use of traditional and established 'pull pathways' to access information rights. Benefits include increasing awareness
and transparency of citizen activation of these rights to access government information, together with a comprehensive
quantitative data set to use as a baseline for future evaluation. This baseline and the assessment approach more broadly may
be applied to contribute to the overall assessment of Australia's Open Government National Action Plan.

The Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC) has provided a submission to the consultation. A summary is available of our
recommendations relevant to freedom of information:
- PIAC recommends that the Australian Government commit to restoring funding for the OAIC across the forward estimates, or
create an effective alternative that can properly perform the functions that the OAIC was created to fulfil. (Recommendation 2)
- PIAC recommends that the Government implement the following recommendations of the Hawke Review:
• certain agencies should be required to justify their complete exemption from the FOI regime to the Attorney-General within a
twelve-month period (Recommendation 19);
• the Act should be amended to provide that the Information Commissioner can declare requests to be ‘vexatious requests’
rather than empowering the Information Commissioner to declare applicants to be vexatious applicants (Recommendation 32);
and
• FOI applicants should have a period of exclusivity with documents they have requested before those documents are publicly
released (Recommendation 37). (Recommendation 3, PIAC submission)
Freedom of Information4.1 Adoption of the recommendations from the Independent Parliamentary Entitlements System Report. I also wholeheartedly
support the recommendations of the Independent Parliamentary Entitlements System Report
(https://www.dpmc.gov.au/taskforces/review-parliamentary-entitlements), in particular:
Recommendation 24: publish all key documents online;
Recommendation 25: more frequent reporting (of work expenses of parliamentarians and their staff) on data.gov.au as a

Recommendation 26: improved travel reporting by Parliamentarians.

4.2 Better transparency and reporting of contracted work. A consistent reporting approach and public access to details of outsourced Government Integrity
contract work with greater consistency of confidentiality rules in procurement. A lot of work is outsourced by government to third
parties. This can be a good way to deliver some things (and there are many arguments as to how much outsourcing is too much)
however, it introduces a serious transparency issue when the information about contracted work is unable to be monitored, with
the excuse of "commercial in confidence". All contracts should have minimum reporting requirements and should make publicly
available the details of what exactly is contracted, with the exception of contracts with national security where such disclosure
creates a significant risk. This would also help in creating a motivation for contractors to deliver on their contractual obligations.
Finally, if procurement officers across government had enhanced training to correctly apply the existing confidentiality test from
the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, it would be reasonably to expect that there would be less information hidden behind
commercial in confidence.(Full blog post on my personal submission at http://pipka.org/2016/03/28/my-personal-ogpau-

Retrospective open calendars of all Parliamentarians business calendars. Constituents deserve to know how their

4.3
Government Integrity
4.4 Apart from the obvious actions required in the area of training, having an efficient feedback system to report lapses, incorrect
advice/actions and inappropriate conduct by government officers is imperative as a corrective mechanism. Most departments
have a feedback system, but their effectiveness differs a lot. (Generally. the more vulnerable and less privileged the average
client is, the overall experience including the feedback system is at a lesser standard. eg: Centrelink has a fairly good feedback
system while DIBP send the complaints back to the same regional office back to the hands of APS3 level officers who -
according to the Audit Office - have had minimal training on important aspects of their work.) These systems should be
substantially improved with a goal to minimize ombudsman referrals. Government Integrity
4.5 Restore the public's trust in government by improving accountability and transparency within the public service. It is often the
case with many commonwealth and state government departments that customer service officers are not familiar with their line
of work, which in turn is an impediment to the efficient delivery of services. Lack of training may be one of the causes. Pure
incompetence may be another. In any case, this situation needs to be improved, not least because some of those who are
affected wouldn't even know they are! (ie. they are compelled to believe what they are told).
Any ideas on how this might be translated into an actionable and measurable commitment would be welcome. Government Integrity
4.6 Government Integrity
Parliamentary integrity in line with international better practice. Ensure that parliamentary integrity provisions are in line with
international better practice Justification: Members of Parliament are public officers and as such must put the public interest
ahead of all personal and other private interests. Unethical or corrupt behaviour is incompatible with their entrusted
responsibilities and undermines and detracts from their performance of their parliamentary duties and hence the performance of
their parliament.
Australia recognised this when it pledged to support the Harare Commonwealth Declaration 1991. The Declaration provided
(amongst other things) for Commonwealth countries:
“to work with renewed vigour, concentrating especially in the following areas:
· the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values of the Commonwealth;
· democracy, democratic processes and institutions which reflect national circumstances, the rule of law and the independence
of the judiciary, just and honest government.”
That pledge clearly indicates that the democratic system, of which Parliament is the peak institution, should function according to
the rule of law, justice and honesty.
More recently, international standards for parliaments were established by the Recommended Benchmarks for Legislatures,
adopted in 2006 by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the UNDP andthe World Bank. The recommendations
include:
10. Ethical Governance
10.1 Transparency and Integrity
10.1.1 Legislators should maintain high standards of accountability, transparency and responsibility in the conduct of all public
and parliamentary matters.
10.1.2 The Legislature shall approve and enforce a code of conduct, including rules on conflicts of interest and the acceptance of
gifts.
10.1.3 Legislatures shall require legislators to fully and publicly disclose their financial assets and business interests.
10.1.4 There shall be mechanisms to prevent, detect, and bring to justice legislators and staff engaged in corrupt practices.
Each House of Parliament should adopt its code of conduct independently as each is autonomous from the other House. Neither
House of the Parliament of Australia has adopted a code of conduct.Comparable parliaments, such as the UK House of
Commons at Westminster and the Canadian House of Commons, have well-established and highly developed integrity systems
including codes applying to their Houses and Members of Parliament.
However, codes of conduct and like instruments (e.g. code of ethics; conflcit of interest code) do vary widely in their provisions
and effectiveness. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association commissioned Recommended Benchmarks for
Codes of Conduct Applying to Members of Parliament, published in 2015. These recommendations specify the principles that
should be incorporated in a code of conduct and complementary provisions, having regard to local circumstances e.g. the size
Government openness - efficiency and effectiveness Lack of openness means that those parts of the public that must comply
Government Integrity
with government direction do not have a full understanding of what they are supposed to do or why they are doing it. Lack of
compliance leads to enforcement actions that are expensive.Some of these would be unnecessary if the government told people
what they needed to know.
Lack of openness leads to sloppy and incompetent decision making within government because undisclosed processes are not
open to question and therefore not open to correction.This disconnects the government from the population.It also starts to erode
the government's wisdom as this disconnection limits learning.Eventually, the government is sufficiently disconnected from
reality to be unable to governproperly because lack of openness includes lack of effective feedback.Thus, without accurate
information on what is happening, poor decision making on the information available and inability to effectively harness the
people to act in a timely manner the government stops being able to respond to events in real time.This is rarely good for a
governments continued existence.It could be argued that openness is a method for staying in power.
4.7
4.7.1
Government Integrity
Very true. Some government departments, however, do not usually need to respond to events in real time, but just provide
services and make decisions on a "one to one" basis. Openness to them, is about having to be accountable. By keeping their
processes undisclosed (and quite often undefined!) and their clients in the dark, they do not have to operate to the same level of
accountability, which means lesser costs (untrained/ improperly trained staff, outdated systems, no feedback mechanisms) to
them but higher economic and emotional costs to the community. Also note that there is at least one commonwealth department
whose clients are predominantly non-citizens who do not have a say in the democratic process! My point is, it is not always in the
government's interest to be open, which is why active campaigning is always necessary.4.8

Network Democracy (http://www.wisdom.to/networkdemocracy ): restoring the balance with real-time, comprehensive citizen
participation across government, democracy and industry / part of Australian Wisdom ( www.wisdom.to/australia)
Network Democracy ( http://www.wisdom.to/networkdemocracy ) is a sub-set of Australian Wisdom. Please see Australian
Wisdom submission on 'Public Participation' theme page and http://www.wisdom.to/australia .
Government Integrity
One network could provide comprehensive citizen participation, governance, transparency, wisdom and access to government
and industry. Stage 1 would deliver Government Wisdom with a specific focuson collective governance. Stage 2 could deliver
broader citizen participation. Stage 3 could deliver build on collective government wisdom and include the democratic process.
Additional stages could include industry/sector governance and other aspects of society.
The article explores 4 opportunities for real-time, comprehensive citizen participation in society:
- Government Wisdom: government reduced to “things” in the Internet of Everything. It provides a more efficient and effective
means to organise government. It also facilitates transparency and accessibility to every “thing”.
- Citizen participation (or Wisdom): Government Wisdom provides the means for “active participation of the people, as citizens, in
politics and civic life. Citizens and the community have access to every “thing” in real-time. The initial focus could be governance,
decision-making and financial financial “things” across government departments and agencies;
- Democracy Wisdom: real-time distributed community participation, contribution and governance across the process of
democracy
- Governance wisdom (industry): this provides the means of distributed community participation, contribution and governance
across industry participants. Community review could ensure communityinterests are also considered.
Government Wisdom is a subset of Network Society. presents an opportunity to achieve a rapid increase in productivity,
accessibility, transparency, accountability (including reducing corruption) and citizenparticipation in Society. The focus within this
article is government governance, decision-making and collaboration.
Government Wisdom comes “Over the Top” and links to governance “things” within the Internet of Everything (IoE) across
government departments and agencies. It acts as an aggregator of information, but also reveals knowledge and coordinates
action toward outcomes. All “things” that embody government can be defined in a single page. Everyone, anywhere can access
every “thing” within government.
Every aspect of government can be reduced to things and books. Things across can be combined into books in an exponential
number of ways for multiple purposes. Things can be combined in dynamic ways in unlimited combination. You can see how
things are connected. This means that knowledge and outcomes can be achieved by simply creating, viewing or things on
mobile devices.
The government is reduced to things and books which can be shared with other bureaucrats and citizens. With every thing
accessible to everyone everywhere, there is a profound impact upon productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency,
Ensure that parliamentary openness procedures are in line with international good practice. This suggestions builds on Henare's Government Integrity
intial suggestion of "Endorse the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness.'
Parliaments must constantly renew their commitments to transparency and citizen engagement. Due to the rapid pace
technological change, there’s a need clear for periodic reviews of policies that influence parliament’s ability to engage; and it is
often helpful to institutionalize this process for periodic review. The Declaration on Parliamentary Openness states that
“Parliamentary transparency policies shall be publicly available and shall specify terms for their periodic review to take
advantage of technological innovations and evolving good practices.” As early as 2004, the conclusions of a 2004
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and World Bank Institute study group on access to information noted that
“[c]onsideration should be given to regular parliamentary review, for example on a biannual basis, of implementation of the
access to information regime.” (Mendel, 2005). The Global Centre for ICT in Parliament (2010) has also established that
parliaments should elaborate “strategic plans, updated regularly, for the use of ICT that directly improve the operational capacity
of parliaments to fulfil their legislative, oversight, and representational responsibilities.”
Recommendation - Institutionalize a regular legislative openness review, in the rules of procedure or in other procedures and
practices that involve the participation of local civil society experts, leading to both changes in policies and potential
commitments.Actively engage with the government in the development of parliamentary openness commitments in future OGP
action plans; either fully integrated intothe countries action plan or as a separate appendix, focused solely on the
legislature.Conduct a parliamentary information audit to ensure that necessary information is made available in accordance with
international good practice.Form or formally task a committee or other body within parliament to monitor parliamentary openness
and citizen engagement efforts.Engage in international fora dedicated to sharing international good practice, including the OGP
Legislative Openness Working Group, to actively learn from other peer institutions regarding emerging best practice on
parliamentary openness.suggested and open for further discussion at https://forum.opengovernment.org.au/t/open-

The Australian Parliament has already done or in the process of doing much of this, according to the Clerk of the Senate, who
Government Integrity
has advised that the:
"Australian Parliament does have an ICT Strategic Plan and we are developing a broad strategic objective list that would take
these matters into account."
I am advised that "legal advice not obtained for purposes associated with litigation is not protected by legal professional

privilege.For all except those authorities which are subject to FOI laws, such advice is covered by the ordinary rules which
protect privacy.Authorities which are obliged to obey FOI laws will or will not be required to disclose the advice depending on the
application to it of FOI principles."
However, if the legal advice is related to a litigation, it is a well established principle that that is protected from disclosure. That
protects the interests of both the person launching the litgation and the person or organisation defending it. However, note (from
guidance on similar English law):
"The test for disclosure where public interest immunity is claimed The CPIA1996 s.21(1) abolished the old common law rules in
relation to the prosecution duty of disclosure and put in its place a new statutory framework. S. 3(6) (in relation to initial
disclosure) and s.7A(8) (in relation to the prosecutor’s continuing duty) state that “material must not be disclosed...to the
extentthat the court, on an application by the prosecutor, concludes it is not in the public interest to disclose it and orders
accordingly.”
The main categories of sensitive material:
*National security/Affairs and interests of state
*Journalists’ sources
*The prevention, detection & investigation of crime
*Material relating to children or young children
These are just the most commonly occurring examples and thus this list should not be regarded as exhaustive. It is also
important to remember that each case turns on its own facts and even cases involving the same type of documents may result in
different disclosure decisions."
Thus in the case involving the ACT Government, whether the advice received by Government can be disclosed seems to very
much depend on the nature of the case. Is the proposal for a simplified means of reviewing
refusals based on legal advice? If so, please clarify.
Perhaps there is a general issue here of the privilege attaching to legal advice (at least when given to Government). It is not my Government Integrity
expertise but I'll ask around.
Provisions of reasons for decisions and easy reviews to rebut these and access to legal advice on the basis for decisions. Often Government Integrity
decisions are made within Government that have profound affects on their citizens.The Government gets tax payer funded legal
advice to limit the rights of their own citizens and then refuses to provide the reasons for their actions, except that it is confirmed
by "legal advice".One example relates to the classification of foster carers as not workers or volunteers for the purposes of work
health and safety.While the Government in the ACT stated that this was the case "based on legal advice", carers were unable to
get access to this advice and question it. The regulator also used the "on legal advice" defence, which leaves citizens with little
to base their objections to policy on.

Private Sector Whistleblower Legislation. Deliver legislation to protect whistleblowers exposing fraud, corruption, tax evasion
and tax avoidance in the privatesector, to match legislation to protect whistleblowers in the public sector. The protection of
whistleblowers is specifically in the Open Government Declaration under "Implement the highest standards of professional
integrity throughout our administrations".
Government Integrity
Research by the Australian Institute of Criminology (Australian Institute of Criminology, Fraud Against the Commonwealth 2010-
2013, Canberra, July 2015) found that over the 3 years between 2010 and 2013, there were at least 265,866 incidents of
suspected fraud reported by Commonwealth entities.
- Each year, substantially greater numbers of external fraud incidents were detected than suspected internal fraud incidents.
- Fraud involving financial benefits was the most frequently reported category of external fraud.
- Over the 3 years, the number of fraud-related corruption increased substantially from 37 incidents in 2010-2011 to 163 in 2012-
2013.
- While the cost of this fraud is hard to quantify and figures may vary, a conservative estimate is approximately $530m over 3
years, with increases from $119m in 2010-2011 to $204m in 2011-2012 to $207m in 2012-2013.
- Over the 3 years, external fraud accounted for $521m while internal fraud amounted to $9.1m or 1.7% of the total reported
fraud losses.
In relation to external fraud:
- risks arise in connection with the provision of new benefits, the introduction of new taxes, procurement practices, government-
funded programs and the use of consultants; and
- the relationship between corruption and collusion between external actors and those public servants working within
government.
The legislation to protect private sector whistleblowers should be based on the recommendations of the Senate Economics
Committee report ‘The performance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’.
The Senate Economics Committee report on ASIC recommended (Recommendation 15):...protections for corporate
whistleblowers be updated so that they are general consistent with and complement the protections afforded to public sector
whistleblowers under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013. Specifically, the corporate whistleblower framework should be
updated so that:
•Anonymous disclosures are protected;
•The requirement that a whistleblower must be acting in ‘good faith’ in disclosing information is removed, and replaced with a
requirement that a disclosure:
oIs based on an honest belief, on reasonable grounds, that the information disclosed shows or tends to show wrongdoing; or
oShows or tends to show wrongdoing, on an objective test, regardless of what the whistleblower believes;
Establish a federal ICAC Actionable 1: Form a working group that would consult with the public,community groups and legal,
Government Integrity
government and business organisations on the establishment of an Independent Federal Corruption Commission with proper
powers (to be decided) to take and act on complaints of corruption within government. The body would also take a role in
advising on anti-corruption measures and guidelines for the public service and parliament.
The implementation of the Register of Lobbyists was a good beginning in increasing transparency however there is much room Government Integrity
for improvement.Forexample currently there is a requirement for Lobbyists to list owners. Many of the Lobbying companies list
as owners various anonymous entities, for example, as holding companies, consolidated funds, investment funds or trusts.
Without knowing the beneficiaries of these anonymous entities, there is no real transparencyaround potential conflict of
interests.See random sample below (list of owners to be found at the bottom of each entry on the Register):
Statecraft: http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/register/view_agency.cfm?id=66
Barton Deakin: http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/register/view_agency.cfm?id=338
Burson-Marsteller Pty Ltd: http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/register/view_agency.cfm?id=88
Hawker-Britton: http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/register/view_agency.cfm?id=96
CGP Solutions Ltd: http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/register/view_agency.cfm?id=265
Actionable 1:To ensure the published list of owners is full and complete naming all the beneficiaries.Where there are extensive
and complex financial networks (and/or where there are shareholders over a certain number), the exact relationship to the
lobbying entity and any subsidiaries should be listed. Smaller family trusts and other business entities should stipulate all
beneficiaries.
Actionable 2:End the scoping study for the sale of the ASIC Register. Make Register free and easy to access.This would make it
easier to ascertain ownership and beneficiaries of business entities. ASIC entries should include all beneficiaries not only the
name of the administering accountant. This would not only assist in improving transparency around lobbying but also around
corporate arrangements in general.
Actionable 3: Institute a ban on former politicians, especially Ministers taking up positions in lobbying organisations, corporations
orin associations involved in lobbying activities on behalf of members.This is particularly relevant where a Minister with former
portfolio responsibilities might enter into a business relationship post- politics that directly relates to their former role; and would
be perceived as conflict of interest whilst in the performance of parliamentary duties.In other words remove the ’revolving door’
between government and business interests. A working group might determine a reasonable period of time to elapse, if any,
before being able to take up such a role post politics.
Actionable 4:Design a plan to reform political donations.The best option would be to ban donations altogether to remove any
conflict of interest and interference in the democratic process. A working group formed to establish a system of taxpayer funded
revenue being used for limited campaigning such as for brochures (letterboxing), shared time for candidates on ABC television
and radio to outline their policies. The Americanisation of political campaigning that requires large sums of money to travel and
spruik does not contribute to the democratic process. Essentially all that voters require is a comprehensive understanding of
policies each candidate/party brings to the electorate so that each can make an informed choice without the distraction of
spin.Ideally, get rid of the travelling campaign buses which are distractions from real intentions.Stick with policy outlines that are
easy to understand including funding.This would also make any taxpayer funded contributions to candidates affordable and
Establish a federal ICAC To build greater confidence and legitimacy in the parliament and ensure that issues of potentially
Government Integrity
corrupt behaviour are
addressed via an independent mechanism, rather than directly by parliamentary peers or departments under the instruction of a
federal minister, establish a federal equivalent Ro the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption empowered to
investigate potentially corrupt behaviour by politicians, their advisors and senior public servants.
This step would raise the transparency and build trust in government and help counter Australia's slide on international anti-
corruption measures. The specific scope of investigation powers should be determined through the involvement of a citizen's
panel and be a transparent process such that Australian citizens can have confidence that the mechanism will meet its goals of
providing an independent review of potentially corrupt or inappropriate conduct that is currently self-investigated by parliament
and agencies.
4.17
4.18
Given that Australia's Special Minister of State, who is currently responsible for investigating such matters, recently stepped
down due to a police investigation into his own conduct, and recent public concern and scrutiny over conduct by other
parliamentarians, the creation of this mechanism would go a long way towards restoring confidence in the Australian parliament
and support the OGP' anti-corruption goals.
Government Integrity
The options are clear and well-known, especially in NSW where the State regulation of donations and expenditure is well-
developed. Further reforms and international comparisons are outlined in the excellent report: "Political Donations. Final report of
Panel of Experts" by Schott, K., A. Tink, and J. Watkins, 2014. Premier Baird has accepted the recommendation that he
advocate a similar Australia-wide scheme. That would be a great starting point.
Improve transparency around political donations. To improve transparency around political donations, pass legislation that
Government Integrity
establishes a single independent entity that administers all political donations; managing collection, distribution to the nominated
party or individual candidate and public reporting. This should be achieved through a digital system that collects, distributes and
reportsseamlessly - making the details of the legal entities making the donation public along with the donation amounts at the
time the donationis made, and detailing any subsequent actions (such as where a party or candidate rejects the donation due to
conflicts of interest, links to crime or other reasons). Political parties should be legally forbidden from receiving donations from
outside this mechanism, and individuals, groups and organisations should be forbidden from offering donations outside this
mechanism. The system should be audited annually and be
paid for by taking a small percentage of donations made (2-3%). The system should have front-end tools for individuals, political
parties and organisations to embed donation taking systems into their own sites,so that from a donater's perspective it functions
identically to makinga donation directly to a political party or organisation.
This approach would allow real-time reporting of total donations by candidate, party and overall - where they are coming from
and build a history of where specific donors have made donations to the same party and candidates.
Unless there is a compelling reason to support anonymous donations, all donations of any amount should be tracked through
this system, with randomised verification and checking methods to minimise the ability of donors to conceal the entity making the
donation.
In the future it would be possible to extend this system to state and local elections as a central system for managing and
reporting all political donations across Australia, reducing the capacity of organisations and wealthy individuals to inappropriately
influence MPs or parties and creating true transparency across the entire system. If possible the system should be designed as
an open source solution and the code made available for scrutiny.

Australian Government's commitment to the UK PM's Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016.Transparency International Australia Government Integrity
is fully supportive of the leading role played by TI UK in working closely with the UK Prime Minister's office to develop a sound
and achievable agenda for the upcoming Anti-Corruption Summit in London in May 2016. Transparency International's priorities
for the summit are listed below. We strongly urge the Australian Government, in the spirit of Open Government, to not only make
public commitments to the final priorities at the Summit, but to also take a leading role in establishing open data as a core
component of those commitments made by world leaders gathered at that time. We also encourage the Australian Government
to develop and ongoing follow-up plan out of the UK Summit that forms a part of the OGP National Action Plan on the topic of
anti-corruption.
TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES FOR THE LONDON ANTI-CORRUPTION SUMMIT
Corruption has a corrosive impact on prosperity, growth, security, and the fight against extreme poverty. Transparency
International believes the London Anti-Corruption Summit provides a unique opportunity for global leaders to signal intent at the
highest level for tackling corruption head-on through concrete, ambitious commitments that can be implemented over the next
five years. Global leaders must form a united front in the face of corruption and take action so that:
- Corrupt groups and individuals are not able to act with impunity and get away with their crimes.
- Businesses receive no benefit from taking part in dodgy deals and operating in the darkness.
- The people who are hurt most by corruption receive justice.
The London Anti-Corruption Summit should generate time-bound commitments that will:
1. Prevent corruption: Make it harder to hide and transfer and benefit from the proceeds of corruption by championing full
beneficial ownership information transparency.
2. End Impunity: Improve the way law enforcement agencies in key countries and between banks, business, civil society share
and act on intelligence, related to risk and suspicions of corruption.
3. Empower and support citizens to seek justice: Promote accountability and citizen engagement on corruption, and protect
activists to do their work.
The Summit should also ensure that the tools and mechanisms are in place to ensure effective implementation and monitoring of
the commitments over a 3-5 year period.
Finally, whilst the UK’s leadership in convening the Summit is welcome, it remains crucial that the UK gets its own house in
order. This is most evident in the need for the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to adhere to the same standards in
the UK with regards to beneficial ownership transparency. They must be required to publish time-bound plans of action for
adopting public beneficial ownership registries.

Integrity of Resource Management. Lead Agency: Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
Government Integrity
Outline
The more effective management of public resources is increasingly recognised as requiring high standards of integrity by public
officers. These ethical standards depend on an integrity system led and practiced from the highest level of the public sector and
followed at every level. The integrity system depends on both structure and culture, and the interaction between them, for its
effectiveness.
Effective integrity systems have been shown to expose unethical, improper and illegal activities that were otherwise undetected
despite their damaging impacts on the efficient and effective use of public resources (e.g. reports by NSW ICAC, Qld CCC, Vic
IBAC). Effective integrity systems reduce the risk of ineffective management of public resources.
The integrity system must operate across all arms of the system of government and recognise that Members of Parliament are
public officers who, as such, must put the public interest ahead of all personal and other private interests. Unethical, improper or
corrupt behaviour is incompatible with their entrusted responsibilities and undermines and detracts from their performance of the
parliament and hence the effective management of public resources.
Australia recognised this when it pledged to support the Harare Commonwealth Declaration 1991. The Declaration provided
(amongst other things) for Commonwealth countries:
“to work with renewed vigour, concentrating especially in the following areas:
• the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values of the Commonwealth;
• democracy, democratic processes and institutions which reflect national circumstances, the rule of law and the independence
of the judiciary, just and honest government.”
That pledge clearly indicates that the democratic system, of which Parliament is the peak institution, should function according to
the rule of law, justice and honesty.
More recently, international standards for parliaments were established by the Recommended Benchmarks for Legislatures,
adopted in 2006 by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the UNDP and the World Bank. The recommendations
include:
10. Ethical Governance
10.1 Transparency and Integrity
10.1.1 Legislators should maintain high standards of accountability, transparency and responsibility in the conduct of all public
and parliamentary matters.
10.1.2 The Legislature shall approve and enforce a code of conduct, including rules on conflicts of interest and the acceptance of
gifts.
10.1.3 Legislatures shall require legislators to fully and publicly disclose their financial assets and business interests.
10.1.4 There shall be mechanisms to prevent, detect, and bring to justice legislators and staff engaged in corrupt practices.
The Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV), the umbrella body for Victoria’s 79 local Councils, is proposing that the Federal
Government Integrity
Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development could deliver more focussed and responsive regional development
programs and services by increasing transparency and public participation. This would occur by establishing an online register of
Community Plans on a regional basis across Australia. In Victoria there are now in excess of 700 Community Plans, which are
documents produced as a result of community-driven processes to identify community priorities in rank order (with number 1
being the most important). These community plans are owned and developed by the community, with the local Council playing a
supporting role. In most cases community members have voted to determine the highest priority projects. Community Plans are
produced in every State and Territory across Australia but in most cases they are not utilised in the development of regional
plans by State and Federal Governments, who produce regional development plans and strategies that are often not addressing
the priority needs of local communities.
By way of example, the Golden Plains Shire Council has about 20 Community Plans documented on their web site at
https://www.goldenplains.vic.gov.au/page.aspx?u=345
Golden Plains Council has a population of some 18,000 people and some 4,000 are involved in the community planning
process. It was only via the community planning process that the Council identified, by examining the common priorities across a
large number of community plans, that there were very significant deficiencies in post- hospital specialist health care in the area.
This has triggered a revolution in health services in the region in the last 5-10 years, supported by State and Federal
Governments.
4.23.1
Proposed by Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) via John Hennessy
The suggested Community Plan register would group and summarise community plans by region and would be updated
whenever the community plans are updated (usually every 1-3 years). This information is currently not aggregated except by
individual Councils, and so is usually not utilised by State and Federal Governments in developing policies or strategies for
regional development. The ability to be able to identify local and regional community priorities from a single source has the
potential to transform regional service delivery so it is more responsive to local priorities rather than adopting the usual cookie
cutter’ approach of programs being developed by bureaucrats on a ‘one glove fits all’ basis. Policy and program developers
would be able to rapidly assess where the gaps are in service delivery: for example, are roads or health or learning or broadband
solutions most needed by local communities? If the Federal (and State) Government is to become more agile, efficient and
effective, it needs to ensure its resources (programs and services) are more focussed on addressing priority local community
needs. In the past decade there has been a massive amount of waste and duplication with Federal and State Governments
producing a range of regional development plans, most of which have sat on the shelf with very little, if any, action. The National
Online Community Plan Register would be the first step to more community-driven public services.
In Western Australia there is legislative requirements for all local governments (approx 140) to have Strategic Community Plans Government Integrity
in place (reviewed every 4 years) These Plans are developed through a process of community and stakeholder engagement and
outline community aspirations/priorities for each local government area. The Corporate/Business Plans for each local
government then outline how they will respond and contribute to these community priorities and may include the role played -
e.g. Provider, Partner, Funder, Regulator, Monitor, Facilitator, Advocate. Local governments have a wealth of information about
their local communities, if there was a process to aggregate all this local knowledge up into one location/data set it would provide
a great learning opportunity for Federal government initiatives - so rather than go out to engage again with the community - it
may be that the the knowledge already exists - gathered through existing engagement processes. The challenge is how to
collate this information.4.24

parliamentary integrity and executive integrity. I reminded everyone that while a commitment template could be developed at the
11th April event around other Grand Challenges and that they would be considered by Government now and in the future
(between NAP's), they would be unlikely to be included in this NAP. I encouraged participants to consider how actions might be

Research portfolio with the NHMRC, ARC and PHCRIS
http://www.phcris.org.au/roar/profiles/index.php?id=11044 OGP Commitment activity suggestion
Need: Keeping and building on ‘corporate memory’
Activity to meet this need
Formal requirement for government staff, five years from retirement, to mentor younger employees for 12 months. Agreement of
the organisation, retiring employee and the younger employee that ‘shadowing’ is an important work task of both employees and
a formal part of their professional development. The basic process is below and this is expected to evolve through individual and
organisation involvement and need.
1. 'Shadow' a senior government employee (who has more than 15 years of government work experience) with the senior
employee purposefully showing and explaining their most valuable work tools and likely barriers;
2. Attend structured meetings to learn from the senior employees long-term lived experience of developing positive work
relationships, dealing with intricate organisational knowledge, managing transitions and agile change.
How it works
The mentoring program has rules and requirements similar to staff training but the content is the lived experience of the senior
staff member's work history. Particularly the technological, social, political, work/home balance and economic capital useful in
enabling more efficient organisation policies, plans and processes. This activity also refines career path planning and
professional development decisions. I strongly suggest that more places for females and minority groups be allocated to this
program to increase government staff diversity.
The benefit to the senior mentor includes reflecting upon new insights, perspectives, information offered by the younger person.
Noting when their work and life experiences are of benefit and can improve current and planned projects. Also, as the senior
employee retires, the organisation may decide to contract the retired person to ‘soft mentor’ senior executives.
Monitor and evaluate
Such employee interaction needs to be a work duty with details of how selection of mentor/mentee occurs, how work is planned
with privacy/confidentiality clauses, the means to review progress and ways to stop the interaction when required. Reporting on
the process is required at 3 month intervals. A common report is prepared as well as individual reports. Work completed during
these interactions will carry both people's names for transparent recognition and appraisal. An employee who has observed the
interactions is also required to evaluate the benefits, challenges and problems at 6 and 12 months.
4.4
The action is to introduce a representation performance reporting system for Members of Parliament, which includes release of
an annual report on the way in which each member represents their electorate. measured against their own commitments
documented in a publicly available "Statement of Approach” prior to election.
The system would work as follows:
Each election candidate would lodge a “Statement of Approach” with the Electoral Commission prior to the election.
The Statements of Approach would set out how that candidate proposes to represent the electorate - both in terms of regular
communication and the extent to which they commit to using participatory and deliberative processes for decision making.
The Statements of Approach would be formatted in a common format (decided by the Electoral Commission using a sound
public consultation method), to improve comparability, and available on-line as well as in public libraries, Council offices etc.The
purpose of the standard template would be to improve voters ability to compare candidates.An annual assessment of each
Member and Senator, against their own commitments in their own statement, would be made each year and reported publicly.
Initially the assessment could be made by the Departments of the Senate and House,
This would sit alongside with their annual disclosures of donations and convicts of interest - and be easily publicly accessible.
The assessment method would be developed by a participatory process such as a randomly selected Citizen's Jury or Civic
Council.
Civil society organisations should be supported to play a role in ensuring widespread public input into development of the
template, the assessment process and, potentially, the assessments themselves.
The system should be developed in year one. In year two sitting parliamentarians could be required to complete the template
and be assessed in year 2 and annually until the following election, at which time the full system (involving candidates) would be
put in place.
This Action will improve the way Australia delivers public services and manages public resources because it will improve the
accountability between elected representatives and the people they represent. Itwill increase Australia’s performance against all

Engagement for OGP
Two comments.
One, you state
“At this stage, it is envisioned that the first Australian Government’s NAP will focus on the two OGP grand challenges of:
• Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of citizen services including health, education, criminal
justice, water, electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by fostering public service improvement or
private sector innovation; and
• More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign
assistance.”
Many outside government might ponder the ‘envisioning’ without outside input that led to this choice of these two challenges
from the five laid out by the OGP, leaving this challenge off the agenda:
“. Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance
reform, and media and civil society freedom.”
Two, experience elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance the partnership concept and add
value. There is no mention of such a body in the published material. NZ, well into the process is just one of many countries that
have now gone down this path.

The omission of a majority of the five Grand Challenges seems incompatible with the very purpose of OGP, all the more-so when Engagement for OGP
those selected do not include:
Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform,
and media and civil society freedom.
Australia's slide down the TI Corruption Perception Index reflects the increasing evidence of improper, unethical and illegal
actions amongst both public officers (including a few MPs) and those who they regulate. We must arrest that slide with its risks to
Australia's governance, reputation and economy.

m writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and organisations for the purpose of engaging with
government in the development of Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and participating in
efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is
developed in the true spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash University)
Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)

Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23
January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more comprehensive web presence, encouraging other
organisations and individuals to contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.

Low key initiative

foundational principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This is increasing being demonstrated in social
purpose programs where those the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the design, delivery and
evaluation of those programs.
However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining membership does not embody that very principle. Informations
session in four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many
sectors of civil society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by this approach to ‘engagement’
For example, PM&C could prepare information suitable for connecting with Indigenous Australians and utilise extant AG, State
and Territory structures to engage.
Just a couple of comments, now that we’re getting to the point of doing things globally.

You’d appreciate that there’s a parallel org to the ogp – the civil society end of gov – so we’ll be able to give you some
comparative feedback on how you go about building the Action plan.au. http://www.ogphub.org/napreview-pilot/
Obviously one of the major products of these plans will developing is a “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (built around a citizen’s
ID). So we can expect (with your imagination) that ad hoc/buckshot approaches like the gov 2.0 taskforce will start firming up into
a platform which may be used by gov, and civil society, groups around the world. http://open4m.org/about-us/
You’re very lucky to have many existing groups of correspondents in various countries already that span between the internal
groups of a government and the civil society groups with which they coordinate “actions”. e.g.
http://forum.opengovernment.org.uk/groups/ogp
One more note as you say “NZ and other governments have generally established their groups after getting the national action
plan developed”. That’s not what they are telling others. “New Zealand (as one) is in the process of setting up a Stakeholder
Advisory Group to assist with developing, implementing and evaluating their plans”. http://www.ogphub.org/blog/advancing-ogp-
in-asia-pacific/
Personally I prefer the way you’re going about it – keeping things open. As Shreya (your OGP contact in Singapore) says in the
doc above, “The important thing now is to sustain the positive momentum generated by OGP and create permanent dialogue
mechanisms, with clear terms of reference, representation drawn from groups that go beyond the ‘usual suspects’ and regular
meetings to strengthen the impact of the OGP process on government-civil society engagement and to mitigate against risks
posed by changes in leadership.”
“Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (as the English call it). “Permanent Dialogue Mechanism”, “Knowledge Exchange”; call it what
you want. That’s one deliverable which every gov wants delivered before the “action” really starts.

TIA congratulates the Australian Government and Prime Minister Turnbull for the recent decision to commit to finalizing
Australia’s membership of the OGP, and for the proactive approach it is taking to public consultation in the development of the
first Australian Government National Action Plan.
Engagement for OGP
The OGP requires broad consultation in the development of the NAP – from the public, civil society and the private sector. TIA’s
comments come from its perspective as the leading civil society organization promoting transparency, integrity and
accountability, and fighting corruption.
Introduction
Now that it has decided to commit to finalizing its membership of the OGP, the government is moving with commendable speed
to draft its first National Action Plan by May 2016, for government consideration in June 2016, and a launch in July 2016. This
speed does bring risks – that the first National Action Plan is essentially a ‘goodwill’ document, not ambitious enough and not
containing commitments of substance. The second risk is that to meet these tight timelines the consultation process will be
structured in a way which downplays the opportunity for real input from civil society and other non-government sectors. The
Government and its advisers may take the view that it is better to have a first NAP, however imperfect, and that the NAP process
and content will be much more satisfactory the second time around. TIA’s job, and that of civil society generally, is to participate
as fully as possible in the development of a first NAP which is ambitious in scope and commitment, and flags priority areas for
future NAPs. TIA is committed to membership of the Australian Open Government Partnership Network recently constituted
The remainder of this short paper flags some initial comments and areas of interest to TIA.
Increasing Public Integrity
5.9
The OGP – Australia website has already indicated that the first National Action Plan will focus on two of the OGP’s five ‘grand
challenges’: Improving Public Services, and More Effectively Managing Public Resources. This decision was made without public
consultation on whether other ‘grand challenges’ should have greater priority, especially Increasing Public Integrity (‘measures
that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom’).
Successive Australian Governments have made considerable and sustained progress in improving public services and more
effectively managing public resources, whereas limited and patchy progress has been made in the areas of corruption and public
ethics, access to information, and campaign finance reform. In other words, there is much more to do in relation to increasing
public integrity. TIA recommends that the Government include Increasing Public Integrity as one of its initial ‘grand challenges’.
Engagement for OGP
Vision
There is not much in the way of a vision in the published material.
Perhaps we couldn’t do much better than draw on the Open Government Declaration thus:
“The Australian Government with input from its citizens is committed to improved democratic practices in line with the OGP Open
Government Declaration:
•“to promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the power of new technologies to make government
more effective and accountable.”
•“to uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, promote
innovation, and create safer communities”
•“to embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and
human dignity in our own countries and in an increasingly interconnected world.”
Grand Challenges
It is disappointing that the published material in parts suggests important decisions about ‘grand challenges’ that may limit
commitments the government is prepared to consider have been made without any consultation.
For example these statements:
“through consultation, the aim is for the first Australian Government’s National Action Plan to include ambitious actions that
support the OGP grand challenges of improving public services and better managing public resources... Contributions for the
NAP will be considered in the context of what will improve public services and improve management of public resources, as well
as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities for business and support innovation in Australia.”
However another sentence brings transparency and accountability and public engagement into the picture:
“Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public service delivery, increase the transparency and
accountability of government, and encourage greater public engagement. It also an opportunity for the public, civil society, and
the private sector to contribute ideas for how government can achieve those goals.”
Unilateral decisions about the scope of what will be considered would be an unfortunate start to a “partnership.”

Utilize the IAP2 (International Association for Public Participation) Core Values and Quality Assurance Standards for Community
and Stakeholder Engagement as the benchmark for public participation for government to incorporate into the way they involve

It is essential to have true collaboration between the government and the public. This is not achieved by the government
dictating what the grand challenges should be. The process that has been adopted in relation to this negates the whole purpose
of collaboration and exchange of views.

bilateral initiatives that promote OGP goals and principles.

relevant, which are available in that Wiki theme).

Engagement for OGP
- Australia’s consultation process in the development of the National Plan should maintain the spirit in which the OGP was
created and focus on genuine partnership and collaboration in order to facilitate improved governance.
5.14
- PIAC recommends that:
• a list of all stakeholders who have contributed to the consultation be made publicly available to demonstrate the breadth of
stakeholders who have participated; and
• further consultations should be advertised more widely, and engage with private companies, legal and human rights groups,
academics and Indigenous organisations. (Recommendation 1)
1. Establish a team with a mandate to broadly improve both public sector and broader public understanding of open government Engagement for OGP
and related issues.
Justification, public sector:: There is a significant knowledge and understanding gap when it comes to communicating with
agencies and local governments, and we need to see communication being one of the major focal points for any reform effort. At
the moment, there are a bundle of things we're trying to break through, from the inevitable 'but this will just mean more work and
cost us money' or 'but this is OUR agency's special project', to some agencies not having a good basic understanding of either
the technological aspects or what we're even trying to achieve.
Justification, broader public: There needs to be more attention given to communicating with the broader public about what we're
trying to achieve, how it's going, what's been delivered, and really showcasing work that has a broad public interest (frequently
maps / social sciences / citizen science) in the context of open knowledge. Things that aren't necessarily economically material,
but are important because they raise levels of public expectation and awareness, ensuring that engaging citizens with data
remains a priority for future governments.
2. Establish a local government (and potentially small-agency) support program to give hands-on assistance in scoping and
delivering meaningful projects.
5.15
Justification: small agencies and certainly local governments will need more than funding to deliver change – there’s a big need
for mentoring and practical assistance. This obviously going to be much harder than just providing funding, but these are very
small organisations and won't get past the stage of developing ideas and scoping a project without both the enthusiasm and
support of others working in the space. (This is not a role for consultants - the engagement has to come from within the public
service to begin with.)
Engagement for OGP
The non-profit sector in Australia takes responsibility for delivering hundreds of thousands of essential services as well as
managing public resources. The Australian Charities and Non-profit Commission has details of over 53000 organisations that are
required to categorise their activities and say whose benefit they are working for. The government use this to include them in
relevant policy and budgeting discussions. The Government could then create an ongoing dialogue mechanism with these
organisations. This could include a system that automatically invites them to participate in policy and budgeting reviews that
effect their areas of expertise and experience. There should also be a budget associated with facilitating participation for the
organisations, given that there are many small and resource-limited. Australia needs their frank and fearless advice.5.16
There is a large amount of data collected by various government departments on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
and organisations. It is therefore important to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sector is engaged throughout
all stages of the project. There is often a level of caution among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations
because of the way data has been used against us in the past. These sensitivities can not be overlooked.
Engagement for OGP
There is also conversations about who owns the data collected. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander orgs are required to report
their data and there is ongoing tensions about who owns that data. Specifically with the AIHW. Data ownership and Intellectual
Property needs to be considered from an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander point of view.
Working with the sector on National Action Plan is vital to consider and address their issues effectively.
5.16.1

5.19
Great to see this input. It would be good to know what kind of stakeholder engagement occurs between the AIHW & the sectors
it collects data from (and provides it to) and how that compares with the principles & themes of the Open Government
Partnership so we can frame up Commitments & actions which better reflect people's needs.
I agree completely and would like to ask if there has been any engagement with Australia's First People's to this point? Is the
National Congress of Australia's First Peoples engaged in the Consultation?
If the first National Action Plan does not address all Grand Challenges, that will leave Australia with incomplete fulfilment of its
OGP membership obligations and without commitments related to the remaining Grand Challenges which complement and
strengthen actions included in that first NAP.
Accordingly, it is proposed that this first NAP include a commitment to prepare the second NAP within which are to be included
commitments related to any Grand Challenges not addressed in this first NAP
I agree with Ken completely. His comment follows the teleconference yesterday and add an important additional point to the
summary of the conversation which Amelia posted earlier today. We recognise that it will be important that in addressing the 2
Grand Challenges proposed by Cabinet it will be impossible to ignore the need to increase public integrity if Public Service is to
improved and Public Resources are to be managed effectively. We also recognised the challenge of engaging the private sector
is integral to the challenge to ensure effective management of Public Resource as Governments increasingly partner with the
Private Sector or contract services to the Private Sector.
The Action Plan implementation process should be designed to include an iterative approach to reinvent learnings, progress,
standards, principles in order to modify accordingly.
How will the action plan evolve with learnings as it is implemented?

• Be bipartisan
• Widen participation during implementation

It would have been good to have this report ready now for use in planning the National Action Plan however when the report is
available it ought to used to inform the implementation of action plan Commitments.
An education campaign to inform the public about relevant 'entry points' into government departments to initiate opportunities for Engagement for OGP
public participation - this requires government to establish information around how, when, why they engage the public and make
this public - so increasing accountability for government. In addition it may contribute to a common understanding of what is and
what is not community engagement/public participation. The IAP2 Quality Assurance Standard for Community and Stakeholder
Engagement may be a useful resource. http://www.iap2.org.au/documents/item/391
An awareness and information around opportunities for the public to participate mean that they dont have to wait to be 'invited to
participate', but are empowered to demand involvement in decision making.
This idea has been added to this theme at the request of Amelia Loye as a way to provide some infrastructure to ensure the
ongoing implementation of the National Action Plan.
Engagement for OGP
An open data/open government Cooperative Research Centre would provide the infrastructure and research commitment
required to make use of open data in the Australian context for policy, business and research purposes. It would also hook up

develop the OGP was discussed initially. Questions were asked about engagement with and from the private sector and the
need to develop messaging for that audience / potential data users was discussed. The limits of the Grand Challenges was
raised. Whether themes were helpful was also openly discussed. The group was also informed by one participant that an
independent researcher had been appointed in 2014 to review Australia's implementation of the initial OGP commitment. The
question about the continuity of the NAP if Government of Australia changed was also raised. There was also a question about
whether / how commitments that could not be delivered over two years would be dealt with - now as the first NAP is developed,
and in the development of the next NAP. The importance of cultural change and the role of time in raising awareness /
encouraging engagement was discussed. I suggested the group contact the OGP team with some of these questions.
The rest of the call focused on five topics: 1) Engaging to deliver commitments and actions - with civil society and the States; 2)
Engaging to report NAP progress, and encourage greater engagement in Open Government across Australia; 3) Engagement
for development of the next NAP; 4) Independent NAP review process. When discussing 1) the group felt multi-stakeholder
working groups would be required to help deliver OGP NAP commitments. Across the states and in some cases with civil
society. The discussion around point 2) included the importance of storytelling, the need for a communication plan and forum /
mechanisms that enable the reporting of both NAP progress, and encourage stories from those sharing from those releasing
data, using data, increasing public participation and opening government across Australia. I made the commitment to ensure that
everyone participating in the workshop on 11th April could participate in a discussion about ongoing engagement. Amelia
The teleconference discussion focused heavily on measurement, reporting & accountability as opposed to Commitment ideas

that could ensure engagement between the NAP actions and greater society. Monitoring the progress of action milestones is
important but I don’t think in and of itself that such monitoring (done by a small group) will ensure the success of the NAP. I think
the success of the NAP will be determined by actions put in place to increase awareness, engagement & opportunities for co-
creation of policy.
nDF would also recommend use of a Citizens’ Jury or similar deliberative mechanism using randomly selected participants to
Engagement for OGP
finalise the National Action Plan. This could be incorporated as part of Stages 3 and 4 of the development process which has
been designed by the Australian Open Government Partnership and would be an incredibly powerful way to set the tone for
future openness and transparency. The clear message which would be conveyed through convening a Citizens’ Jury to respond
to the question of “How can we govern ourselves better?” is profound.
4. Overarching Commitment ; when considering each proposedcommitment and the changes proposed,the NAP commit
Engagement for OGP
toidentifying all relevant risks to the integrity of the performance of the proposed changes and the action needed to address
them.
Whatever specific commitments are made and pursued in the NAP,this will be imperative for a successful implementation of
those commitment.
5.5 In the course of the discussion, particularly under the themes of Open Data, Public Service Delivery, and Resource
Engagement for OGP
Management, it emerged that to ensure that action in those areas will be successful, it will be necessary in the NAP to
adequately address the need to change cultures within government and the major weaknesses in the Commonwealth
Government Integrity system, particularly especially those that can impact adversely on policy decisions and procurement
decisions.
In addition, in relation to Open Data, it will necessary to address the need for an appropriate review of the system in place for its
development.
5.6 Customer-designed information platform pilot
Engagement for OGP
Description: Identify three existing service areas with Commonwealth, state and local government delivery, for example
innovation or small business. Develop a customer-designed information platform focused on increasing information accessibility
about available government services to enable people to more effectively navigate and participate in programs and access
services. It is not anticipated the platform would create a new centralised information portal, rather it would focus on ‘front end’
collation and presentation of information and enable responsible areas to manage the ‘back end’ functionality. While government
would enable and coordinate development, customers (randomly selected) would be invited to co-design and test the platform.

Publish What You Pay (PWYP) Australia believes that the OGP can be used by Australia to improve extractives industry
transparency. We support the comments made below by TIA and strongly endorse Australia progressing with implementation of
the EITI standard. We also support the introduction of mandatory disclosure legislation that requires extractive companies listed
or based in Australia to disclose all payments made to governments on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. This
legislation should be harmonised with existing laws introduced by the European Union and Governments in Canada and the
United States to the extent that that is possible.
We fully support the position of PWYP Australia on the implementation of EITI standards in Australia and the introduction of
mandatory disclosure legislation similar to the ones in Canada and the US. This will complement our work on transparency and
accountability of the mining sector in the Philippines.
Publish What You Pay UK strongly supports the recommendation of PWYP Australia for extractives industry transparency under

transparency with promote a greater level of trust in the community of what large corporations are doing both within Australia and
overseas. It will also enable fact based discussion on the just distribution of the benefits of the extractive industries within the
community. Increasingly people are viewing multinational companies with suspicion and hostility. As they push their way into the
lives of ordinary citizens, invading farm lands, spoiling the environment and depriving indigenous communities of their humble
means of survival (particularly in many poorer countries), they are judged as being powerful, undemocratic and representative of
the rich and greedy. This is a strongly growing trend. While the executives of such companies are legally required to maximise
the financial benefits of their shareholders rather than required to act in a way that is in the best interests of the public generally,
there is a social divide that is likely to grow. Transparency is in the best interests of the community. Government Data for

transparency and drive public participation in the development and management of Australia’s natural resources.
The Australian Government is best placed to coordinate and publish national data related to mining and resource production
applications and projects and their status.
To deliver this the Government will need to support collaboration between all agencies, states and territories and create a way to
enable them to effectively share and publish data in a consistent national structure. This data should be updated daily or weekly,
shareable, and be open in allowing companies and citizens to build on and reuse the data.
6.6 Create community-focused content explaining mining, resources and energy project processes
The Australian Government could provide a single national source of easily understood community-focused information about
our natural resources, mining and production processes, and the rights of citizens and industry. This will foster more open and
better informed discussion between citizens, industry and agencies about management of Australia’s natural resources.
With more state government decisions on resource projects becoming a part of the national conversation, the Australian
Government has the opportunity to create the foundation for an informed discussion by providing national content, including
relevant details for each state and territory.
Educational content created for citizens will transparently explain the different natural resources in Australia, their uses and
values, and the process and impacts of mining/extraction. The participation and cooperation of each state and territory in
providing information about relevant local rules and legislation, will ensure openness is delivered nationally. Content will be

The second would be to ready Australian policy makers with the burgeoning field of ‘smart contracts’, distributed data and
decentralised organisations. New technology (including blockchain) depends on this format. The possibilities range from
automating the calculation rates, duties and penalties to crowdsourced-drafting of bills and regulations.
Provide linkages between the law that requires data to be collected and the published open data
Open Data
One potential step is to create a data register by agency on what data they hold, what state it is in, and what access is permitted. Open Data
This could become a bi-annual report to government and available to all agencies to help those making decisions to understand
where the data supporting their decision process may already exist and be sourced.
It could then be reviewed and released publicly (where there's no security implications), providing insights for industry and the
civic sector on what data is potentially accessible from government to inform economic and social decision processes, as well as
providing a gap analysis on what data government doesn't hold and a runway for individuals and organisations to request
specific datasets to be publicly published as open data, or selectively shared with researchers to inform future policy work.
From this a high value data list could be determined through the interaction of the various players.
7.1.3
Such a list should identify gaps in data, so that social and environmental impacts can be covered comprehensively. OGP must
be about more than "how to make money out of government-generated data"
Creating the opportunity and mechanism for the public to contribute to this list is a good way to engage a broad audience with
open data, to move beyond the current focus on the interests of developers and the short term thinking of hackfests. The health
and welfare communities have specific data-sets in mind that they wish to have opened to improve policy outcomes. Providing a
formal opportunity for these groups (and the wider research community) to provide input into such a list would build both interest
and trust in open data/open government.
Establish a single place to discover all consultations, publications, policies - it is currently difficult for people to contribute
meaningfully to government because it is hard to find what is going on, what has already been decided, what the priorities of the
government of the day are, and what research has been conducted to date.
Establish a participatory budget approach. Each year there should be a way for the public to give ideas and feedback to the
budget process, to help identify community priorities and potential savings.
Establish a regular Community Estimates session. Senate Estimates is a way for the Senate to hold the government and
departments to account however, often the politics of the individuals involved dominates the approach. What if we implemented
an opportunity for the public to do the same? There would need to be a rigorous way to collect and prioritise questions from the
public that was fair and representative, but it could be an excellent way to provide greater accountability which is not (or should
not be) politicised. (full blog post on my personal submission at http://pipka.org/2016/03/28/my-personal-ogpau-submission/)

Open Data
Develop a central register of all public research undertaken, or to be undertaken, by federal agencies that provides details of the Open Data
scope and links to publicly reported outcomes. Over time could be linked to the raw data for reuse by other agencies/external
entities per other open data and internally could become a mechanism for agencies to find existing research relevant to policy
processes and to collaborate on research projects where the similar data collection could serve the goals of different agencies.

7.4 Suggestion to meet - *Access to Information, *Open Data and *Openness in Natural Resources areas
Open Data
NEED: Extending access and use of existing Australian best practice information by Government institutions and participating
community groups
BACKGROUND: I have observed over many years the National Parks and Wildlife Services and aboriginal groups trying to work
towards an ongoing collaboration. What I don't understand is why the Service staff do not check for current successful
‘collaboration’ programs (or part thereof) in their own Service to share with the people involved in the project. An example of a
successful program is that of Mungo National Park.
STRATEGY AND MEASUREMENT: To expand use of valuable information by Government and Community groups.
A five step process can begin
Gather and make best practice collaboration program reports easily findable (a one stop shop);
Notifying (regularly - twice a year) all regions that this 'one stop shop' is available, and that
A Service person or persons are required to log in to this 'shop' each month, search for information associated with their annual
projects, and distribute the results (via email with links or as paper copies for people without email) to people responsible for
project delivery and all members of the project team; including the Community groups.
All project leaders must personally load their final reports to the ‘shop’.
These logins are recorded and reported.
There may be a better way - but I haven't witnessed use of current successful processes in the Service and local aboriginal
group discussions.

There may be a better way - but I haven't witnessed use of current successful processes in the Service and local aboriginal
group discussions.7.6
Problem: Many reports and resources commissioned by government departments and agencies are not made public.
This could be addressed with 3 strategies:
1. Review and strengthen guidelines for making information resources commissioned or produced by government departments
and agencies public to ensure all material is made public unless there are identifiable security or other justifiable reasons not to
do so.
2. Set targets and measure results for open publishing and use of creative commons licenses
3. Develop a government open access policy similar to the ARC and NHMRC
An open access policy should be adopted for all government funded research published in academic journals. These could be
similar to that of the ARC and the NHMRC and should also encourage use of open access journals where available.
Open Data
This proposal would also require the established of a government document repository or some other solution for effective
storage, discovery and access - this has been submitted as a separate item.
7.6.1
7.6.2
It is, if the reports are made public. If they aren't its either an FOI issue, a management issue or an openness issue. Reports are Open Data
withheld for a variety of reasons and public servants needs to be clear on what these are and be able to justify not making a
report public. We have the Gov 2.0 theory but not yet the practice.
Open Data
As I hear it, the problem with many reports and resources commissioned by government departments and agencies not being
made public is implementation of existing policies, guidelines etc. As Amanda points out "We have the Gov 2.0 theory but not yet
the practice."
We need suggestions that will improve compliance, as well as plugging any holes found in policy.
Sharing b
Open Data
7.6.3
This suggestion closely aligns with concept of a "Gov API" or "Mashable Government". Pia Waugh describes the end goal:
https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/making-government-discoverable/
To achieve "Gov API" in a long term sustainable manner is non-trivial, but can be broken down into many small steps. Key
concepts which need to be considered are:
Open Standards facilitate wide scale and long term interoperability. However there is tension between "quick fixes", or "vendor
lock-in APIs" versus open standards adoption.
Adopting existing international standards is often an option and should be encouraged where available. Contributing to
development of international standards is time consuming, and involves long term commitments to do well.
It is important to enable whole-of-government strategies while also facilitating rapid innovation.
Maintenance strategies: IT assets, such as government data, rapidly become dated and need refreshing and/or archiving. As
such whole-of-life maintenance strategies should be considered.
Business Cases: (This is worthy of a suggestion by itself). Government agencies should be provided with strategies and
guidelines to write business cases to predict the success versus cost of different Gov API strategies. Typically government
officials have mandate to solve department-wide problems, however solutions will often be best justified at a Whole-Of-
Government, or Whole-Of-World level. One particular argument is "If I invest in an Open Standard, or Open Source product, I will
see minimal immediate benefit, but long term will see international adoption which will lead to advancement of my local goals."
7.7
Problem/issue to be addressed
Open Data
Publications and other resources produced or commissioned by government departments and agencies are notoriously difficult
to find and access for a number of reasons including having publication withheld, or disappearing from online access due to poor
management practices and lack of a public repository for government material.
Main objective
Improve the discovery and accessibility of government publications, data and other resources to maximise long term public
access and use of government research and information by investing in publishing infrastructure, principles and practices.
Strategy: Establish an open publications repository for government documents
Establish a public, open access, online, whole-of-government publication and resource repository for publishing and ongoing
access and management of government publications.This could utilise and extend an existing external repository to integrate
with other policy resources (using APO for example apo.org.au), use a government-run system (data.gov.au) or be a new
product developed for this purpose. It should be interoperable with data.gov.au and other data sources to link publications and
date and would be able to be harvested by Archives and other organisations as required but also be public facing and dynamic
to work with the fast pace of public policy.

7.8 Open Data
This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the National Archives). The National Archives was established
by the Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it has existed in various forms since
the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in government through its
legislated role of setting records and information management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and preserving
and providing a public right of access to government information.
Open government increases the transparency and accountability of government, encourages greater public engagement,
strengthens governance and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key role in open government by
promoting the creation, management and preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information, and
facilitating access to this information.
The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and effectively covers all information created, used or received in
the course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) (Archives Act), the National Archives:
•identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
•preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth accessible;
•oversees Commonwealth records management;
•determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
•imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.
Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of
successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government policy. It is from this perspective and with this
legislated role that the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on the Vision and the framework for
the National Action Plan.
7.9
7.10
7.11
7.11.1

Vision
The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved management of, and accessibility to, information and
records. A key element of this is a move to fully digital information management and business processes across the Australian
government sector. This aligns with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the United States, Canada and
the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st century needs
to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a
number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading including earlier access to government records, the Digital
Continuity 2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.
With regard to models for such an enterprise, I can only endorse the NZ comparison and strongly recommend that you look at
Open Data
the UK initiatives in relation to open government and open data. Placing the open data strategy within the ambit of the National
Archives. along with Her Majestys’ Stationery Office, focuses on government information across all sectors – creation, use, reuse
and preservation.
http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/united-kingdom
Open data can provide useful input to both Grand Challenges of Improving Public Services and More Effectively Managing
Open Data
Public Resources. The government has done its own research on the benefit of administrative open data sets published by the
Productivity Commission (2012-13). I think a useful goal for the OGP National Action Plan would be to compile a list of high
value data-sets that can be used to contribute to better policy, transparency and accountability and then oversee the release of
these data-sets along with implementing a feedback process to ensure the data produced is usable. This list should be created
in collaboration with the public and provide a standard to facilitate maximising the value that can be created through open data.
Develop a federal research register
Open Data
To allow more informed citizen participation in policy debate, make a commitment to publish (redacted only where absolutely
necessary) all business cases for major government initiatives and all independent evaluations of policies and programs. In the
case of proposed initiatives, it would allow citizens to be aware of the options considered and the relative pros and cons of each
proposal; in the case of evaluations, it would allow citizens to be aware of factual information about the success or failure of
policies and programs. Citizens deserve to be able to make up their own minds based on factual information, not through the
lens of the 'spin' of either government or opposition, and to question decisions which do not appear to be supported by the facts
or independent recommendations - or at least require the government to be more accountable to the public for the decisions it
makes.
This could be connected to my proposal for a research directory - which had a goal of informing government agencies of the
Open Data
research activities by other agencies and supporting more collaborative research across portfolios where this was cost-effective.
The public exposure of this research, base, benchmarking & comparative (policy) to the public at an appropriate point in the
policy formation process, with appropriate privacy management, would support more informed and factual policy debates and
reduce the hyperbole and misreporting we see in current policy discussions.

Open Data
In August 2015 the NZ Government agreed to establish a Data Futures Partnership, a cross-sector group of influential people
working together to drive high-trust and high-value data use for all New Zealanders. Australia could take a similar approach, and
in particular use and adapt the 'catalyst project' seed funding model NZ is developing to foster more data driven innovation, more
open data release, and more effective trusted data sharing.
Background:
The NZ Data Futures Forum consultation process found there are likely to be huge economic, social and environmental
opportunities from treating data as a national strategic asset. It also found that driving social and economic value from data
requires a collective effort across the public, private and NGO sectors.
It noted that:
1. The data-use ecosystem is hard to navigate - Data practices and relationships are complex and emerging, and the existing
institutions and frameworks are not designed for the emerging environment. There is no clear, authoritative guidance for
Ministers and policy makers, or for the people and organisations sharing and using data.
2. Potential for much greater data sharing - Public and private sector organisations have rich data but are unwilling or feel unable
to share – because acceptable boundaries for sharing and reuse may be unclear.
3. Tenuous trust - Public trust in the data-use ecosystem is tenuous and, once lost, trust can be hard to restore. Maintaining trust
is vital to ongoing data innovation, including Government’s reuse of data to drive investment decisions and target services. There
is no independent trusted forum for an inclusive conversation on data use.
4. Potential for more data reuse and innovation to create economic and social value - People and organisations are not using
data as much as they could to create value – because of lack of understanding of the value, lack of access to data, fears of
negative reactions, or practical barriers such as no data standards or lack of analytics capability.
7.15
The Data Futures Partnership is focusing on three streams of work:
- Catalyst Projects to demonstrate the value of data use, and help create ethical and practical frameworks.
- Diagnose and fix ongoing and emerging issues in the data-use ecosystem.
- Facilitate a conversation with New Zealanders about the potential value of data use, and to understand their feelings and
perspectives on data use.
TOPICS
Open Data. A linked data system would:
- Present the complete picture without administrative boundaries on topics that interest citizens and governments
- Connect the data silos by creating standardised APIs across agencies
- Create a standard workflow for releasing, updating, and using open data by processing all datasets in the same manner
through an automated and repeatable process
- Generate five-star open data for all datasets.
Open Data
PRINCIPLES
- Transparency. An improved workflow for releasing data through an automated linked data workflow will contribute to greater
transparency.
- Technology and Innovation. Linked data introduces an innovative system and approach to managing transparency as well as
managing public contributions to open data, fostering increased usage for all.
What successful implementation of the idea would look like
A linked data portal will achieve the following:
- Relevant and easy access to government data by citizens
- Specific and focussed search, as well as discoverability of data
- Easy publishing and automatic extraction of topics from data, decreasing the amount of processing
- Workflows for any data contribution.

1. Lisa wants to release her agency's education data, currently stored in proprietary formats, so that it can be used for a
consultant to develop an app
2. She uploads the data into the linked data portal
3. The portal automatically extracts entities in the data (eg: 'University of Sydney', 'CSIRO', 'National Portrait Gallery') and
locations (eg: 'Brisbane', 'Carlton VIC')
4. The portal then creates an API (Application Programming Interface) for the consultant to develop the app
5. Lisa can re-upload the data at any time to update.

South Wales on a pilot project to mitigate the health issues associated with the increase in the number and severity of recent
heatwaves that have been linked to climate change. This pilot is at the start of a 5 year lifespan and it would be invaluable to
incorporate open data from the specific fields of climate and health to enable a much more targeted and rigorous engagement of
the potentially effected population. Often in regional areas specific individuals or clusters of citizens are hard to service or even
locate due to their geographical isolation.
There are a number of posts, in different themes across the wiki, suggesting a directory / portal / list of open government & open Open Data
information initiatives and resources etc. For example, see "Compile a list of high value data-sets" by BudgetAus below & and
Pia Waugh's submission: http://pipka.org/2016/03/28/my-personal-ogpau-submission/.
In my opinion much of the right model for such a portal would be that provided by the EU Open Data Monitor
(http://opendatamonitor.eu/) as proposed below by StephenGates ("Bring the Open Data Monitor to Australia to help in the
discovery and assessment of open data quality").
7.18

7.19.1
7.19.2
The role of a similar portal in AU would be to provide a central catalogue/directory view of initiatives & information and to foster
and document the likely disparate usage terms & conditions, formats and interfaces underlying the information & resources. The
portal should not, I think, provide any underlying centralised data storage nor identity / access management function to
information and resources.
The United States and other countries have established teams responsible for 'declassification', or opening, of government
archives that were closed under past decisions. Access norms and expectations change. Such a group could be established and
managed by the NAA to ensure that these valuable government records, covering all aspects of Australian life, are made
available to the Australian people in a timely manner.
Currently Commonwealth agencies operate under two different sets of rules and accompanying approaches to the release of
information. FOI, which is limited by its use of the word 'document' in reference to information that can be requested, and open
data policies, aimed at structured information. This is an unhelpful distinction. All formats of information - from databases to
documents and everything else should be easy to apply for under FOI, and all should be eligible for proactive release. Suggest
necessary amendments to FOI legislation to remove use of 'document'.
Correction: there aren't only two sets of rules - there are lots more eg privacy law, archives law, But the intention in this comment
is to focus on the tension between FOI's 'documents' and open data :) CF
This is just one aspect that illustrates the need to modernise the FOI act, made all the more urgent by the transition by
government agencies to entirely digital work processes. Section 17 of the FOI act and its reference to computers is straight out
of-well 1982, when the law came into effect. My proposal for a short review is in the Freedom of Information theme.

Open Data can dramatically decrease the real and opportunity costs to not for profits and other organisations. We have seen the Open Data
power of shared measurement in many of the collective impact initiatives in the US and there is an increasing call for 'population
level' data sets here in Australia to assist collaborations report and mobilise around common agendas. Without access to timely
and quality data these efforts will be stalled. There is a moment in time while people are putting together dashboards/scorecards
etc to enable these communities - health, education, employment, justice, economic data is all necessary and needs to be
accessible in raw formats (and not 3 year old data sets). How can communities hold not for profits and government to account if
they can't access timely and accurate data? For better outcomes we need data to benchmark and track outcomes and also
understand the context of these communities.
Using Open data to get the best talent into Government Departments, changing work culture: Transparency in Hiring and
Open Data
Promotions in government departments and business units
Some departments advertise with the clear intent to hire, some advertise just to meet the legal requirements. Frequently, some
departments or business units carry out hiring and promotions internally because of a culture of everyone "fit in". In such
instances, there are no new ideas coming in, there is no one to question internal decisions (because all employees are made of
the same mold). This culture perpetuates itself. This results in a lack of Innovation in policy making, lack of innovation in other
fields including procurement and infrastructure development (including ICT, communication or implementing OGP ideals). There
is no dissent- because there are no dissenters.
Actions Item:
Each subunit of each government department should be required to disclose on its own website and its hiring advertisements as
to the absolute number of new hires from outside the group in the past one year, and the number hired internally- including
contractors already working there. Such data should be provided/published in a form that can be scrapped by open-data bots
and consolidated for access by the public.
7.21.1
To make OGP successful, we need to have employees at Departments wanting to do the right thing.
I agree that this is a grave and timely issue. Let me introduce commitment 20 from the current French NAP, which is very
related:
Open Data
DIVERSIFY RECRUITMENT WITHIN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
LEAD INSTITUTIONS: Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service
STAKES
The civil service has a duty to be exemplary by reflecting the French society it serves, with its diversity and its evolutions.
CONTEXT & AIM
The State undertakes to facilitate the recruitment of diversified profiles that not only reflect French society, but also that are
necessary to support the administrations through digital and open government evolutions.
ROADMAP
Develop new access channels to the civil service, to improve its opening to society
- In the Bill on ethics and the rights and obligations of civil servants, insert measures to renew access channels to civil service
and open them a larger diversity of profiles
- Renew the preparatory classes mechanism for access to competitive examinations of category A in the three branches of the
civil service, particularly by increasing by 25% the number of places offered in the integrated preparatory classes preparing
candidates for the competitive examinations for entry to the civil service from 2015. The objective for 2016 is to double the
number of students, to reach 1,000 places
- Develop apprenticeship in the civil service by multiplying by 10 the number of apprentices, to reach an objective of 4,000 by the
beginning of the 2016 school year and 10,000 for 2017
Address discriminatory biases upon entry into the civil service
- Upon request from the Prime Minister, launch an expert appraisal mission on discrimination issues
- Modify the texts on juries and selection committee’s composition for each ministry to open them to at least one member outside
the recruiting administration
- Generalize training courses on discrimination prevention for all future members of juries and selection committees
- Generalize the procedures for the quality certification of human resources departments in order to evaluate all their procedures
with regard to any discriminatory risks. Ashok, your proposed action is very simple and costs almost nothing to the departments,
but arguably the first step towards addressing this problem. Hopefully, it becomes part of a commitment. Even if it does not,
simple things like this could be easily implemented IF the government is willing...

Open Data - dealing with cross jurisdictional issues: Many policies dealing with the every day lives of people are administered by Open Data
states which makes the state agencies the custodians. Such data-sets are important to the issues that the health and welfare
sectors would like to see opened for better policy & funding transparency. Other than the Australian Institute of Health & Welfare,
the only other avenue of collaboration between jurisdictions in relation to the collection of data that I am aware of is the Cross
Jurisdictional Open Data Government Community Forum which is a quarterly meeting that discusses open data case studies and
issues.
I propose this cross jurisdictional committee be used to create a structure or process (separate to their private meetings)
whereby the public can engage with the states to begin to harmonise the open data-sets that are produced by each state and
territory so that data-sets on similar topics in each jurisdiction (eg traffic, crime) can be published in a consistent manner with
regard to the fields they contain, the frequency with which they are updated and other characteristics that affect their re-use as
open data.
Open Data
3. Establish and enforce metadata standards for publishing data and publications
- Establishing document/resource ownership can be a challenge sometimes when it comes to government publications. It would
be helpful if resources were more clearly marked than they are currently. Parent/child relationships would be a good place to
start. Eg: Australian Government, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Office for Women. Copyright ownership also needs
to be reformed to be more consistent. In the example given, resources can labelled Copyright Commonwealth of Australia OR
Copyright Australian Government OR Copyright Office for Women. A publishing standard, which ONLY attributes copyright to the
'master' owner, would be a great reform.
2. Discover, access and management of government publications
Open Data
- Another observation (and this mainly applies to state government departments) would be to stop uploading reports as Word
docs. PDF should always be the default format, especially helpful for researchers that need to keep pagination consistent for
citation purposes.
Open Data
Just to pick up on some of the points raised by Amanda Lawrence - in relation to government publications
2. Discover, access and management of government publications
- Most federal and state government publications are usually 'findable' close to release date. Older publications can be a bit more
problematic. NLA and Trove collections are often a first port-of-call for researchers trying to receive historical publications.
Allowing third party repositories, that have the (content management) systems to publish associated copyright information, to
archive such documents improves the chances of policy researchers to retrieve and evaluate publicly-funded policy resources.
1) XML feeds for all parliamentary data including Hansard, comlaw, annual reports, pbs', MP expenses and declaration of
interests in data form with notifications of changes. This would make this important democratic content more accessible, easier
to analyse and easier to monitor.
Open Data
2) Publishing of all the federal budget information in data format on budget night, including the tables throughout the budget
papers, the data from the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBSs) and anything else of relevance. This would make analysing the
budget easier. There have been some efforts in this space but it has not been fully implemented.

FOI requests (ongoing as well as closed) and their outcomes (and documents provided to applicants) should be published on the Open Data
Home Page of the department or business unit. For example, CentreLink should have a link to all FOI related matters. If it is not
possible on the top of the page, a link should be provided at least at the bottom of the Home Page. Data format should be open
data bot scrappable.
Achieving internal Transparency within government departments and sub-units using bot scrappable open data. In government Open Data
departments, when new positions or groups are created, the business unit would be required to inform all employees in that
group (and all its cohorts and parent groups up to the first SES level) about the rationale for creating the position or group,
source of funding, and goals for the new group or position. This will prevent new groups or positions being created without being
much thought over long term needs, and also prevent groups just because funding is available or it fancies a particular person.
This would, at least in a small way, insulate interference from elected leaders or lobby groups.
Policies and decisions made by such newly created groups can potentially become an impediment for other groups, they can
become ill-managed and wasteful. Instead of a lean and efficient government, we could be left paying the salaries of a group for
decades, this group being a hindrance, rather than help, to better governance. Keeping information free flowing and open will
prevent frequent occurrences of such cases. Before the creation of such a group, data should be published in a form that can be
scrapped by open-data bots and consolidated for public viewing. When there is a need to be become transparent, there will be
caution
Personal Data has value. By making it Open to the person the person can realise the value. What and how to make it open
depends on context; as it does with all data.
Instead of thinking of Open Data we can think of Open Access in Context. Applications define context. Rather than think of
opening data we can think of opening applications. With personal data we have the added complication of privacy. Allowing
individuals to use approved applications to access personal data removes the privacy issue.
We can use the same approach for all data. That is, Open Data through Open Access in context
Open Data7.29.1
Trial opening applications instead of opening data. Organizations holding data are responsible for the data. They can approve
applications that access data.

To that end an ogpau action item could be:
Run one or more trials using open applications on personal data.

Summary of Open Data teleconference 30/3/16. Eight people attended this teleconference: Ash, Ken, Kevin, Linda, Tim, Mel,
Open Data
Rosie and I. We discussed the need for data standardisation, cultural change, greater transparency around data sets available,
participation in the release / prioritisation process and accessibility of open data sets released across Australian States.
Participants felt that the Federal Government should play a coordinating role and that cross-jurisdictions structures should be
established and managed by Federal Government to coordinate this. There was mention of an Open Data Steering Committee
and COAG. The group felt that engagement between those responsible for the release of data was as important as well as
executive commitment, and the importance of cross-jurisdictional engagement from staff in similar agencies across was
emphasised. A communication strategy and 'How to guide' was also suggested by participants as other ways this coordinating
body might to make these processes, and data release across Australia more transparent, increase awareness of it's value and
promote use. Amelia
List of high value open data-sets. Perhaps I was not clear enough. The list of high value data-sets I suggested as a an OGP
Open Data
Commitment is not intended to be decided by government but by the public.
While everything could be considered data, for most people data is different to publications or other kinds of resources. Its great Open Data
and important to make more data available but other resources such as government reports and discussion papers,
submissions, FOI type material, archival material etc are very badly managed and are highly likely to be overlooked if the theme
is Open Data. Why wouldn't FOI be part of this theme? Is it because information is not considered data? It doesn't make sense
to separate them. Moving away from a data only focus would also help to engage many people who aren't necessarily interested
in data but do want better access and management of other types of Public sector information such as government publications
and records of many kinds, both public and restricted.
If you did this then you can see we have a few main suggestions. If you look at the list below its basically:
1. discovery, access and management of data, including publication of specific, high value datasets
2. discover, access and management of government publications
3. Establish and enforce metadata standards for publishing data and publications
4. collation of data on government activities such as research projects, donations etc
plus if you take the ideas from FOI it covers
5. Greater support for FOI and the OAIC,
6. Copyright reform to introduce fair use or fair dealing type legislation
I'm not trying to reduce anyone's ideas here, just to show how data is related to and part of the wider government information
ecosystem, including legislation, and it might be more productive to have an overall strategic approach to information, not just
data.
7.32.1
7.33
7.33.1
Amanda Yes "data" needs to be seen in the broader context of information. FOI reforms in 2010 included a small step in
Open Data
extending pro-active publication requirements. Data sets ( and format issues) should be subject to mandatory provisions of the
FOI act not as now left to discretion.
Assist the 500+ local councils that haven't yet published open data to do so: Do this in a standard way that helps people answer Open Data
questions without knowing what jurisdiction they're in
Open Data
Part of this approach should include support for standardising how data is collected and published by local councils (or for a
standardised subset of data collected alongside any jurisdiction-specific data), or providing mapping of council data to a common
central standard with a data quality metric (such as the 5 star system) to allow effective comparison and aggregation of data
across LGAs. This would also help address reuse as there is far more economic and social value (and hence incentive) in
developing a service that is national than a service that is functional and accurate for only one LGA, or necessitates a great deal
of data matching and cleaning at significant expense for 500+ datasets with slightly different collection and publishing standards.
I recognise that data standards are painful to negotiate and implement and often fall foul of specific interests, but if this process
can be negotiated, the outcome provides broad and deep value and long-term savings.
7.33.2
Another idea is, given that the majority of councils publish on data.gov.au, streamline the data publishing pipeline to make it easy Open Data
to publish high quality data.
E.g.
- upload data
- nice UI to add contextual information about the data
- automatically infer a schema from the data
- optionally allow the user to refine the schema (e.g. a column identified as a string, could be a set of valid values. Let the users
define these)
- check the data against the schema and report errors
- allow the user to fix errors or publish with data quality statement
- publish to CKAN
On the consumer-side, display the human-readable context, schema and data quality statements and make machine-readable
versions available programmatically.
Many of the components to do this already exist as part of the Open Knowledge Frictionless Data project http://data.okfn.org/

Open Data
Local Councils tend to collect and manage highly valuable local-centric data. In our experience gained working with private
sector consumers of data, demand for local-centric data far outweighs supply. It is so important to help local government become
gold star publishers through guides and tools which make it EASY. These suggestions are great.
Release all data maintained by the Public Sector Mapping Authority as Open Data: Fund the PSMA to continue their good work Open Data
but publish the data openly.
The Queensland and Federal Infrastructure Plans both identify data as a key enabler to get the most from our infrastructure
investments. Releasing a national transportation network should be one of the first objectives.
PSMA has released it's Admin Boundaries as open data - is this proposal still relevant or can it be redefined to more specific
datasets?

one of open data's biggest challenges: USABILITY of open or shared data. We are hoping to complete our localisation work in
the next few months as we finalise and eliminate as much complexity as possible via the 'help guides'. It would be great to see
these applied across all open data portals in all Australian jurisdictions.
The internet of things is coming and Australia's open data platforms aren't ready. They generally publish snapshots of databases Open Data

not sure has been pursued as vigorously in the last few months.

Proposal: Streamline government IT purchasing practices to understand, then capitalise upon the opportunities of open
technologies: open source, open data, open standards, open architectures.
Open Data
Government IT investment would benefit greatly from increased adoption of open technologies, however government purchasing
practices inadvertently favour proprietary, vendor lock-in strategies over open business models. A paper should be written
exploring the fundamentals behind this dilemma, leading to changes in purchasing practices, and the provision of purchasing
guidelines for assessing the difference between different open products, and comparing the value of open and proprietary
business strategies.
Identify a process for Government agencies to share what data sources they are working on so as to avoid duplication but also Open Data
to share costs in developing data
Public Service Delivery - how Government works with other agencies, the community and industry, how citizens find services
Again, the USA have established a Digital Strategythat requires all Federal Government Agencies to identify what they are doing
to provide open data (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-
government.html#milestone-1-1) and although this has been enforced within the Federal Government, local American state
governments are also using the strategy to guide the their digital strategy work (I worked on one for dc.gov but there was no
facility to share with other state governments), there was no facility to publish along with the Federal agencies to allow sharing
and understanding between all levels of government.Australia could benefit from ensuring whatever the NAP involves that all
state and territory governments also participate and that there is a way to ensure a sharing of knowledge, skills and costs.
An example of where data projects can be shared is in the mapping space; there are various other government departments who
are working on mapping solutions and who are making great headway in the UX and access of data particularly in the mobile
space and this could be where the National Map and other government departments should pool resources to provide improved
mapping facilities (including the data they are gathering and providing) but having some standards and guides in place for
mapping usability and accessibility.
7.6
Reporting of data and information
Open Data
With the establishment of the Public Management Reform Agenda (PMRA) there will be a change in how information is reported
by government departments and agencies, the old structure of an annual report will be replaced by information that is more
useful for the public (and more user friendly to read and understand) – data will play a big part in this change of reporting – it will
especially be important for making graphical and interactive content to match the strategic goals and objectives of an
organisation – it will also need to be updated more regularly and the reporting mechanism will be fluid – data will be used to help
not only inform but also highlight important information usually lost in content of a report.

National Metadata Standards
- Description: Development and adoption by all Australian government jurisdictions (and local governments) of national metadata
standards for key open data categories and spatial data sets to ensure national consistency in publication and improved
accessibility and use for data end users and the public. A key objective should be to enable greater transparency and
comparability of public administration services across the nation.
Identify ways to manage and view sensitive data – not just for security reasons but for a person’s privacy
Open Data
There is comment by Amanda Lawrence posted on the Open Data theme: This theme should be Open Access to Information - or
something similar - not 'open data'. Specifically her item no. 4:collation of data on government activities such as research
projects, donations etc
There will need to be guidance and standards around access of data where the research projects can identify individuals, who,
how and where this data is available will need to be considered carefully (we have been doing some work recently with a
research institute in NSW and the data and statistics they have available could identify individuals if not managed with clear
security access measures)
The USA have identified this in their plan and are looking to “Streamline the Declassification Process”, the Australian NAP will
also need to consider this aspect to ensure national security and privacy issues are not compromised.8.1

Improve the democratisation of public problem solving and government's capability to engage citizens and organisations in
addressing social and governance channges by implementing a whole-of-government challenge platform with agency training
and support methods in order to support government agencies to put out both 'grand challenges' for the design/conceptualisation
of solutions to large problems (ie the design of Canberra and the Opera House) and for small challenges (ie the design of tools
and messages to promote healthy eating by children). This could be strongly based on the US model (www.challenge.gov).
Proposed by Craig Thomler
My intent with this suggestion was to support how government raises, manages and sources potential solutions for policy
challenges with the public, rather than on the side of opening government to citizen-led engagement.

As such while a challenge platform could eventually allow for citizen-led challenges, the intent is to provide an alternative and
broader approach for agencies which buttresses some of the flaws in procurement processes by providing a mechanism to
engage on smaller challenges, in non-monetary ways and to attract broader responses and ideas from the community than is
possible in a procurement approach (which only reaches a small subset of entities with potential solutions).
Extending a challenge platform to citizen/industry initiated challenges would be a (distant) future stage, or better managed
through a different process (per the NSW & Vic government approaches or a petition-based approach).

"Establish an open and transparent process to encourage unsolicited proposals from the public, business and industry. This
would enable all levels of business to contribute not only ideas but infrastructure, services, and alternative business models to
support the delivery of public services and infrastructure." leads to 'all lobbying (unsolicited proposals) be required to go through
an open and transparent process, easily accessible by all'.
Yes: 'all lobbying (unsolicited proposals) must be required to go through an open and transparent process, easily accessible by
all'
In support of more direct democracy and broadening the role of citizens in governance outside of the electoral cycle, introduce a
capability for citizens to introduce legislation into parliament for debate and a vote, borrowing from the models introduced
successfully by Estonia and Sweden. This would involve a series of gates that a piece of prospective legislation would have to
meet before being submitted to parliament, including receiving initial support (X supporters online), being framed as legislation
(through the support of a volunteer/part-funded legal capability), being modelled (with the support of the affected portfolio
agencies) and then receiving a level of community support that indicates a significant desire for the legislation (X supporters
online). When it goes to parliament for debate and voting, the votes for, against and abstentions should all be captured and
reported with the legislation for transparency reasons.
There could be a commitment to trial this with a small number of Bills and review within the first National Action Plan period.
How about making sure that people can participate with the open system we have- local MPs, the political system? Response to
suggested actions from participants at the Ark Community Engagement Conference 22/3/16
Commit to a six or eight week public exposure period for all laws before they are voted on by parliament, with a capability for
individuals and groups to propose amendments and identify issues with potential laws before they are put into practice. Ensure
that the exposure occurs in a public manner, potentially with the capability for individuals and organisations to register for alerts
by topic for laws that impact on their lives and activities. Create a review and response mechanism that ensures that all
considerations raised are addressed publicly in plain english such that the rationale behind the purpose and specific wording of
each law are clear to the people it is to be enforced on. Currently the exposure period is quite short and is not well promoted,
thus often laws are passed with little scrutiny and with significant drafting flaws, which are only identified in later implementation
and must be amended over time. The process above would significantly reduce the error rate in legislation and add an extra
consultation step for addressing specific aspects of laws that have not been fully considered in relation to the citizens and
organisations affected.
This needs to be supported by a default requirement for consideration of each Bill by a parliamentary committee which invites
submissions and holds public hearings, as happens in New Zealand and many other parliaments.
Appropriate period of time should be determined by level of impact. Base standards on the IAP2 standard and core values -
including quality assurance standards and timeframes. Formal guidance for Federal Government agencies may need to be
developed. Response to suggested action from participants in IAP2 P2 for OGPAU teleconference 21/3/16
o All laws could be impractical, perhaps a focus on areas of public interest
o Conversation around ‘what do we want to be engaged on?’ e.g. should we be leaving policy around nutrition and food to the
experts to legislate, or do we include the community in something they don’t necessarily have expertise in it
o More thought around timeframe- flexibility.
o Matrix- pt system. Determine point system to create time weighting
Response to suggested actions from participants at the Ark Community Engagement Conference 22/3/16
o Important to seek views of the wider community. Give equal weighting to community views? What happens with vocal groups
that may be the minority gets heard without the consideration of other non-vocal groups
o Mechanism to provide access to information on policy consent
Response to suggested actions from participants at the Ark Community Engagement Conference 22/3/16
To mitigate the current state where agencies all consult citizens to different degrees and via widely different methods, develop
whole of government guidance and consultation capabilities that focuses on evidence-based policy development over Ministerial
fiat. Currently some agencies employ advanced online consultation tools and/or wide-reaching community engagement, while
others employ very basic and opaque techniques, often with consultation methods selected and funded on a project by project
basis with wildly different approaches and techniques for engagement even when similar topics are being considered. A central
capability with clear and public guidance on how and when agencies must engage the public and stakeholders would remove a
great deal of the ability for departments or Ministers to rule by fiat, with limited or 'hidden' consultation (such as burying a white
paper deep in a website, or holding consultation events with a specific limited set of stakeholders unknownst to the broader
community affected by policy changes). This should include a central register of all government public consultations, including
mechanisms for people and organisations to register for alerts for consultations touching on their areas of interest. This
approach would help normalise the consultation process for citizens, who would be able to easily discover consultations on
topics of interest to them from different agencies through a central location, would be able to respond to consultations in a more
standardised and user-friendly way, and would provide support for a broader range of consultation approaches for smaller
agencies that otherwise cannot afford to employ techniques which may be more effective than those they currently use. The
likely end solution would integrate technologies from different consultation providers, as well as custom functionality (which may
be paid for by a group of agencies to share costs) as well as consultation support and training services to ensure that
consultations are designed and executed to deliver effective outcomes. Note that I have witnessed a number of 'wasted'
consultations where the process, response mechanism, or framing approach resulted in limited usable responses - a waste of
public money and potentially politically dangerous where the government receives an inaccurate picture of community views -
addressing this area in the manner outlined would significantly reduce this waste and likely reduce the overall cost of
consultation across the entire government. Proposed by

refining service delivery; and support the potential in our community to manage public resources. I would also like to see public
participation in the way we deliver, report and monitor delivery of this National Action Plan – not just public reporting.

Public Participation
There are already some ways citizens can contribute to the democratic process.For example, there are opportunities for public
participation in some reviews, audits and parliamentary inquiries. This could easily be expanded.
8.9
Actionable 1:Form a working group to discuss areas in which it would be possible to involve public participation in policy
formulation to build upon those already available.This could be facilitated by opportunities to submit ideas regarding how

Public Participation
Open Source Package for Consultation and Collaboration. There are many open source apps that can be used for both
engagement and collaboration. The quality, interoperability and ease of installation in this area has gone up dramatically.
Australia could lead the way by creating a special, open source technology package that makes deploying and customising
these apps far more accessible to government IT departments. Interoperability with proprietary tools would also be possible. This
would allow innovative engagement and collaboration projects to get off the ground more quickly for less money, with more
connectivity between projects.
This approach solves three critical challenges in the use of online for citizen engagement:
1. Duplication: Government spends too much time procuring and setting up online engagements, and not enough time making
them succeed
2. Dissipation: Government is forced to rebuild their audience for each new consultation, rather than maintaining a base ready-to-
engage citizens who can be proactively invited
3. Fragmentation: Insights from each consultation are stored separately in different data formats, preventing the government
from discovering trends and insights from across all consultations
To support this outcome, we propose foregrounding the principles of open innovation and genuine collaboration, to allow the
Government to continuously improve the platform by:
- Accessing the full range of the nation’s digital innovation talent base, both within and outside government
- Partnering with other governments, both domestically and globally, to add value to the system
Further, we recommend a “community source” solution that uses open source software best practice, supported by strong
collaborative governance to decide the content of the codebase and the software roadmap. We also recommend use of standard
software frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Django (Python), as well as open data standards, to ensure that all components
of the system are developed in a way that is accessible to a range of providers and participants across the nation. Benefits of
this approach include:
- Avoiding license fees and pay-per-user models that make the system prohibitively expensive as soon as you are successful (ie
at large, national scales)
- Future-proofing the system to enable integration of other open source and proprietary engagement solutions
8.10
People's Food Policy Process for Australia: Since the food system is foundational to all life, and existing and future wellbeing and Public Participation
sustainability, it is imperative that the voices of as many Australians as possible should be heard in developing a coherent, long-
term, fair and sustainable food policy for Australia.
This links very clearly to the pillar of citizen participation, leading in turn to more responsive, innovative and effective governance.
Similarly the development of an authentically participatory process links directly to the two grand challenges prioritised by the
Australian government, i.e. 1) "Improving Public Services" - especially health, education, and water - by fostering public service
improvement or private sector innovation; 2) "More Effectively Managing Public Resources" includes measures that address
budgets, procurement, natural resources and foreign assistance.
An excellent model for a participatory process of engaging with large numbers of citizens in the development of a national food
policy is the People's Food Policy Project of Canada, which produced the ground-breaking report: "Resetting the Table":
http://foodsecurecanada.org/people-food-policy. This was adapted at a smaller scale in Australia in 2012-3 by the Australian
Food Sovereignty Alliance with the development of the People's Food Plan for Australia:
http://www.australianfoodsovereigntyalliance.org/peoples-food-plan/. Earlier participatory policy development processes that had
significant and important outcomes, as well as very well-regarded and transparent processes, were the Purple Sage project -
https://vwt.org.au/1998/11/purple-sage/ - and the WaterMark project - https://vwt.org.au/2007/11/water-mark/ - both led by the
Victorian Women's Trust.
8.11
As a first step, I would encourage the Australian government to endorse the Urban and Regional Food Declaration, which has
been developed by Sustain: The Australian Food Network (www.circlesoffood.org) and can be read here:
http://www.circlesoffood.org/urban-and-regional-food-declaration/. The Declaration has been endorsed by the City of Melbourne,
Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, the City of Ballarat and the City of Greater Geelong, as well as numerous other institutions
and organisations.
Public participation principles: Public participation in government needs clear definition of what ‘government’ is. The Parliament Public Participation
and executive government have been elected to act on behalf the people – they need to be kept accountable and responsible for
their decisions. The administrative arm of government is usually tasked with the research (including community consultation and
engagement), development (including co-design and collaboration) and implementation of policies, services, programs, etc.
Public Participation in each of these two ‘government’ arenas should not have a blanket approach applied.
We need to be sure the differences are articulated and then a set of principles is developed to be applied to each. These
principles should include, at the core, a commitment to open government and public participation and should be underpinned by
a diversity, inclusion and human rights framework.
8.12
A Facebook for Public Participation: Digital platforms have made real time data a reality for many spheres of life but has yet to
Public Participation
find its way into public participation in government, policy and feedback. Rather than invest in yet more out dated surveying
approaches and technologies, we could bring real time data and feedback into selected areas of government. Just imagine if this
Wiki was data powered and visualised, we wouldn't just know that there were 67 comments, we would have breakdowns of
those comments by theme and topic or wordcloud, we could get a sense of the breadth of participation by location, electorate,
demographics etc.
Examples could include using real time data and dashboards to report on:
Management of public resources (budget vs actual)
Public service improvement
Indicators of private sector innovation.
In terms of actions:
1. Narrowly pinpoint a problem worth solving (eg measure the outcomes - not outputs - of the federal Innovation Statement in
terms of fostering private sector innovation)
2. Identify the owner (ie Christopher Pyne)
3. Formulate this as a challenge for the upcoming GovHack event

Public Advisory Panel: Public participation in government should be in public hands.
There should be a peak public organization – called, say, Public Advisory Council (PAC) - which:
• monitors government activities
• maintains a data base of public organizations and individuals with interests in particular issues
• assesses which government activities appear to require public participation
• determines the nature and extent of the participation needed
• advises interested public organizations and individuals about the requirement
• assists organization and individuals in preparing material and participating, particularly those with limited resources
• collects, collates and analyzes material from them
• also, of its own volition, collects, collates and analyzes material including by professionally conducted, reliable and valid
quantitative and qualitative surveys (as advocated by Bob Douglas in his suggestion)
with the use of unprofessional surveys, as currently are prolific and which misrepresent public opinion, being proscribed
• prepares and makes submissions based on that information
• prosecutes the public case with government, opposition and cross-bench Members of Parliament.
The system would not preclude interested organizations and individuals from making their own submissions and representations.
The PAC could also act unilaterally if it identified an activity in which no known public organizations or individuals had an interest.
Advantages would include:
• the potential for a single, powerful submission embracing a wide-range of public opinion, simplifying the task of government.
• resourced-starved Opposition and cross-bench MPs would receive the same powerful submission rather than a collection of
submissions with which they have to deal.
• (One of the first issues the PAC should deal with would be the lack of resources available to Opposition and cross-bench MPs
– democracy would be enhanced if they were to have far greater resources)
• most importantly, public participation would be controlled by a public organization, devoid of government involvement
This would be a major organization which would be:
• financed by government using a fixed formula which guarantees minimum funds
• staffed by a highly-qualified meritocracy of personnel from a multiplicity of disciplines
• have a structure which would enable it to cover all government activities e.g. it could have as many advisory panels as there
are ministerial portfolios.
This suggestion arises from a decade of individual advocacy for greater public/client involvement and benefits in legal regulation,
stemming from being a victim of a major fraud in an Adelaide law firm’s trust accounts.
The fraud exposed the near-monopoly in the development and administration of legal regulatory systems (they are state and
territory responsibilities).
I firmly support this proposal. I have previously published a proposal for a Public Interest Council which, I would argue should
have at least similar if not superior standing to The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) .The paper is
available as the closing essay in a volume published by Australia21 about public Interest .http://www.australia21.org.au/wp-
content/uploads/2015/02/ATT00055.pdf.
All government engagement feedback should be kept in an accessible permanent archive. All comments collected from
government engagement processes could then be accessed in the future becoming a record of the methodology, level of
engagement and the nature of the dialogue. This would become a ongoing testament to the progress of public participation in
Australia as well as a useful archive of comments on important issues through history.
All government agencies across all levels should be able to run their own engagement programs, using their own methods, with
their own tools, in their own time. This means providing guidance, principles and support to government rather than rules and
regulations (beyond jointly agreed minimum standards).
As per my comment on the Engagement theme, it is vital that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisation are
engaged through all stages of the process. There are numerous issues and concerns about the large amount of data collected
by various government departments and who owns the data. There has also been concerns about how data has been used
against us in the past.
There should be a seperate engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations to give adequate
consideration to our issues and concerns.
The key to good engagement is to involve those affected in the development and design of the engagement process. For
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from a Non English Speaking Background, people with intellectual or
physical disabilities, children, youth, seniors and other people - all should have the opportunity for input into the engagement
process for whatever the project or activity may be.

I recently read the unflinching external review report on the DTO's Gov.au "alpha" release
[www.dto.gov.au/standard/assessments/gov-au-alpha/] and it made me wonder what would happen if we applied the discipline
and structure of good digital asset design - in this case, rebuilding the federal government's web front end - to the business of
policy making.
Public Participation
The question forms part of a longer standing speculation about the relative lack of progress we've witnessed in the application of
the tools, culture and practice of "digital transformation", which have mostly been used in a service delivery context, to the way
we conceive of, and execute, the policy process.
By and large, the deeper reaches of the policy world have been relatively "transformation free", at least in the sense we've
witnessed how the mantra of digital disruption has upset many of the instincts and habits of work in other part of the public
sector. That has been the result, I think of a mix of pragmatism (start at the relatively easy end of the spectrum with service
delivery) and more or less stout resistance from those anxious, for a whole range of reasons, to preserve and entrench the
inviolability, and even elements of the mystery of their work.
What struck me about the external review report, written by reviewers from the UK's Government Digital Service (on which the
Australia DTO has been closely and deliberately modelled), is the combination of three factors which framed the task of
designing and implementing a digital service or asset.
The first factor is an agreed, accessible and authoritative basis of design 'rules' and principles that define the context and
process of design, build and implementation; in this case, the whole process is governed by the DTO's design rules.
The Digital Service Standard [www.dto.gov.au/standard] consists of 14 principles or criteria against which all digital design and
delivery should be judged. Their purpose is simple:
The Digital Service Standard establishes the criteria that Australian Government digital services must meet to ensure our
services are simpler, faster and easier to use. Meeting the criteria means we can consistently provide high quality services and
satisfy our users’ needs.
Some of the criteria include "understand user needs", "...use an agile and user-centred approach," "measure user satisfaction
and... measure and report other metrics publicly" and "make sure the service is simple enough that users success first time
unaided."
8.18.1
The second factor is an open process of external review designed to hold the people doing the actual work to account. But,
although the approach can be tough and uncompromising, it doesn’t appear to be undertaken in a traditional "audit" mode which
Now That's a Grand Challenge and a half, one that requires a big shift in culture which at present prefers closed rather than
Public Participation
open processes.
Peter Shergold's recent report wants stronger protections for public service thinking, John Lloyd describes FOI as "very
pernicious' and John Fraser said the important stuff doesn't get written down these days. Such a culture change needs constant
leadership from the top and reinstatement and funding support for the watchdog and advocate of open government, the Office of
Australian Information Commissioner, an office the government still maintains should be abolished despite the fact a majority in
the Senate opposes the necessary legislation to achieve this.8.19
Provide a way for citizens to easily engage electronically with government agencies. To engage with citizens government
agencies needs ways to know who they are talking to. Another way of expressing it is that citizens need ways to tell agencies
who they are.
There are two general approaches to identification. One approach is the single identity approach. This is often called single
signon.
Public Participation
The alternative approach is to take advantage of existing identity systems. This approach gives citizens ways to link their existing
identities. Using this approach a citizen can identify themselves to an agency. Once identified with one agency the citizen can
reuse their identity with other agencies.
This approach leaves data in data silos. It protects data through the use of approved applications. It provides a private secure
identity system. It requires no new legislation or regulations. It is low cost. The system is agnostic to who owns the data silos.
This means it integrates with civil society and with private industry identity systems.
An action item for OGPau is to.
Trial a system where citizens have access to information about themselves in existing systems. Citizens verify their identities
each time they engage with an agency. A citizen's online identity is the combination of all existing identities.
(note privacy principle 12.4b states that an organization holding data about a person should: "give access to the information in
the manner requested by the individual, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so".)
Once a person has a connection with two agencies the person can copy data from one agency to the other. The trial system will
do this for any task requiring the reuse of personal information. There are hundreds of potential trial situations.
The savings generated from the first implementations can fund implementations for other applications. The government will only
need to seed fund the first application.
Advertise to agencies whether they would like to participate in an innovation trial on sharing personal data across agencies.
8.19.1
An alternative to this action item that achieves the same purpose.
Public Participation
For Open Government to work we need citizen engagement. The mechanics of engagement matters. Personal data in
government systems are in self contained data silos. Taxation data is separate from Health data which is separate from Law
Enforcement etc. For a meaningful engagement with citizens it is important to maintain these silos.
The Australia Card and other national id proposals were attempts to link data silos. The reasons to do this were claims of
efficiency of administration. But, when we hard link personal data silos the efficiencies prove to be imaginary. This happens
because the functions performed within the data silos interact. These interactions make it difficult for each individual system to
change and adapt. The interactions increase costs that soon overwhelm any savings.
In Australia the latest attempts to integrate data silos are mygov and ehealth. Both have proved to be expensive and have
increased costs. This has happened because both use the same identity across personal data silos. This creates a hard link
across silos. A hard link is when something about a person changes in one silo it changes in the other silo.
Both mygov and ehealth are being overhauled. These attempts will have limited success. The reason is that the overhauls
continue to use a common identity.
The alternative to using a common identity is to continue to use different identities for different data silos. To communicate
across silos we link common data across data silos. But we do it without using a common identity. This is a weak link because
changing data in one silo may not change it in other silos.
Open Government initiatives will fail if citizen engagement uses one identity for all engagement. The Open Government
movement should use different identities for different engagements. It is important to maintain personal data silos for different
government services.
A possible action item for Open Government is.

Open Government engagement uses different personal identities for different types of engagement.
In the book Bringing Citizens Voices to the Table by Carolyn Lukensmeyer she says that:
Public Participation
"This book has a very specific objective: to see our nation’s practice of democracy reflect the aspirations for self-governance that
were embedded in our founding documents; to actually be a governing system “of the people, by the people, for the people.”We
must have systems and mechanisms in place to achieve that goal. So, as we call on citizens, decision makers, and our federal
government to adopt new citizen engagement practices, we must simultaneously commit to building the infrastructure that will
support those efforts. Together, new practices and underlying supports can generate a strong, reinforcing pattern of authentic
democratic behavior. " Carolyn's book outlines seven requirements:
A legislative mandate for participation
Safe, accessible physical spaces
Broader access to technology
A facilitation infrastructure
An organizational infrastructure
A trustworthy, fact-based media
Robust civic education
Perhaps we need to consider what this infrastructure looks like now, identify where is already exists and then build on this as

Management of data collected though engagement - 'invited data': Establish systems, protocols and procedures to ensure that
Public Participation
data collected through citizen, community and stakeholder engagement can be shared across agencies while ensuring privacy is
retained.
Having a centralised system to track and coordinate engagement activities and enable the sharing of data collected across
agencies and projects will also make the time and money invested into participation in engagement more efficient for both
stakeholders and government. It will enable greater coordination when addressing social issues, measure and monitoring social
impacts and outcomes, and refine services and programs.
These systems and processes need to be designed with respect to privacy, enabling consent and self-service and by
segregating data and user access, but they are essential if we want to build on existing data, understand trade offs and impacts,
and work together more effectively to address complex problems. They enable participation beyond consultation and are
necessary for collaboration - across agencies and with parties outside of Government.
8.23
Systems implemented will need to enable the analysis and reporting of both qualitative and quantitative data, AND support
communications and the management of relationships generated through engagement. Agencies will need to work together to
determine appropriate reporting metrics, taxonomies and user access.
A three yearly, publicy commissioned and funded, statistically valid random survey of voters in every electorate, to assess
Public Participation
satisfaction and experience of open democracy and identify concerns. Currently, the polling of the Australian population about
their concerns and aspirations is undertaken by political parties, media groups and those with a particular axe to grind.
Many of us have our own view about why the Australian electorate is currently disenchanted with our democracy but we lack the
essential data, based on neutrally funded and neutrally conducted, comprehensive, systematic surveys.
I propose that the Commonwealth Electoral Commission, should, every three years, commission a statistically valid random
sample of voters from each Australian electorate to be interviewed using an interview schedule, which asks open questions
about general life satisfaction, work/life balance, childcare, employment opportunities, education opportunities, health care
experience, political representation, views on the environment, defence policy and spending, levels of taxation, housing
opportunities, transport infrastructure, community engagement, sense of security, the role of government and the private sector
and the basic assumptions underpinning the operation of the economy.
The results of this survey should be made available to every voter, in the period that precedes the subsequent federal election.
We all accept our responsibility to be counted in the census. I suspect that most Australians would similarly welcome the
possibility of providing their views in this way as their contribution to open government.
8.23.1 I wanted to say how much I like this idea proposed by Bob Douglas. Given that it is coming up to Census season, the idea that
rather than treat Australians as passive recipients of policies derived from a mandatory survey like the Census (the design of
which it would appear Australians have very little say), an alternative/complimentary survey that actually asks Australians what
they want and are concerned about seems more in line with policy co-creation and principles of the OGP. Public Participation
8.24 Public Participation around complex subjects: There has been good progress in bi-directional communication between citizens
and government. There are now excellent tools to run YES/NO polls past many people to gauge community sentiment.
A challenge worth tackling is how to enable public debate and evidence based decisions on complex topics - such as Climate
Change. Complex systems require significant time to understand, which makes them susceptible to misdirected influence from
vested interest groups. Questions to consider:
Who will fund "trusted experts" to research and advise on complex issues so they can make informed decisions?
How can a community vote on complex subjects?
How do you address the signal-to-noise ratio within community discussions? Public Participation

8.25 Always-on community listening: Initiate an always-on program of listening to the community, using both digital and face to face
methods of community listening and engagement. E.g. Using social media monitoring and other analytics tools, map key
concerns and pain points of community members to geographic data; use this data to underpin ongoing conversations and
workshops with local communities that are focused on their needs and concerns first, not the priorities of policy-makers.
8.26 Enable full and equitable participation in new policies and programs. This could be achieved by bringing together broad and
Public Participation
diverse groups from across civil society to form a panel whose remit was to interpret, evaluate, and in some cases paraphrase
new policies and programs. Thereby enabling deeper understanding and broader civic engagement across the community. This
would result in the Australian public being better placed to make important decisions around the policies and programs that
affect them.
Summary of public participation teleconference 30/3/16. Nine people attended: Alvaro, Leanne, Ken, Bob, Ash, Marcus, Kevin,
Public Participation
Rosie and I. Bob spoke to his suggestion of a national survey and at the start of the call the group touched on the differences
between actions suggested and participatory, representative and deliberative methods to engage / increase participation. This
group felt that before talking about methods and suggested actions, the Federal Government should declare a commitment to
increase public participation and define principles that could be applied / demonstrated by agencies. They worked together to
shape up this commitment statement: "We value the wisdom of members of our community and will create diverse opportunities
for them to work on issues that affect our communities." When shaping up this statement the group briefly spoke about culture,
public servants as citizens, that not all residents are citizens, and that public participation should be then having a say. Potential
lead agencies discussed included the DTO, PM&C, Public Service Commission and the role of the Governor General. The group
felt that PM&C should lead this commitment and work with agencies to deliver the first action / define principles for public
participation, and that agencies could then deliver some of the actions suggested to demonstrate commitment progress and
reporting against principles. Milestones / actions under the commitment could include the digital, participatory, deliberative,
representative methods to increase participation suggested under this theme. Amelia

Australian Wisdom Network ( www.wisdom.to/australia ) : The Zero Marginal Cost path to Society Growth, universal public
Public Participation
participation, democratisation of every sector and economic/government transformation. "Today, the main contradiction in
modern capitalism is between the possibility of free, abundant socially produced goods, and a system of monopolies, banks, and
governments struggling to maintain control over power and information .... Everything is pervaded by a fight between network
and hierarchy. Paul Mason"
'You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model
obsolete' R. Buckminster Fuller.
The Australian Wisdom Network ( www.wisdom.to/australia ) is a new model based upon Zero Marginal Cost Network to crowd
create economic transformation, government transformation and Network Society and achieve Society Growth for all Australians.
Australian Wisdom Network applies the Network Society development model to deliver the "1 Australia in 1 Global Village"
objectives of 'Society Growth', Minimum Life (enhanced Basic Income, Economic Transformation, Government Transformation
and to accelerate the evolutionary Shift from Industrial Economy to Network Society. Zero Marginal Cost Networks (internet,
massively scalable 'blockchainified' databases, wisdom networks, mobile devices, distributed apps, distributed databases, open
source software etc) and the resulting Network Society development model offer a superior, efficient, effective global and
costless means to organise society (sectors, countries and the Global Village) and focus community wisdom on society
outcomes and a Minimum Life (enhanced 'Basic Income') for everyone.
If Australians sat down with a blank sheet of paper today, this is the 'Australia' they would design for tomorrow. It is a quick, easy
and comprehensive paradigm (or platform) shift using current technologies. Simply, every 'thing' in every sector across society
has a virtual representation in a society-wide, blockchainified, massively scalable databases accessible to everyone. Wisdom
Networks organise and focus the wisdom of crowds around every 'thing' in society, everywhere for everyone via mobile devices.
The outcome is a real-time, Zero Marginal Cost, transparent and accessible Network Society that delivers a Third Industrial
Revolution jump in productivity and quality of life for everyone. The crowd can begin with a small problem and expand to sector,
country, region and the Global Village.
Australian Wisdom enables the 3rd Industrial Revolution, distributed prosperity, distributed governance, economic
transformation, government transformation, all-inclusive citizen empowerment, democratisation across every sector,
regional/global integration, regional integration and accelerates the shift towards a Network Society and a global humanitarian
platform.8.28.1
Comment on the ideal organisation to deploy was also requested.
Public Participation
The ideal organisation to deploy Australia Wisdom (within government) would be the Digital Transformation Office.
Approximately, 30 people would be required and it would cost a few million dollars. In its current form, the DTO is a service
provider to other government departments. Other government departments still make the decisions as to the degree of
transformation that the DTO can enable.
The DTO may need to follow the Malaysian model and be given statutory powers to implement Australian Wisdom across
government. A discussion of the Australian vs Malaysian approaches is provided in the article 'What is Transformation? 4
Purposes of Government ‘Transformation’ departments (theatre, advisory, incremental, metamorphosis). Examples: Australia,
Malaysia' at http://www.wisdom.to/transformation.html .
In fact, Australian Wisdom can operate independently of government. It can be launched and the people use it directly to
manage their 'things' across sectors in society (health, education, equity market, innovation, governance, government etc).
People can add their 'things'. Australian Wisdom can also scrape things from the internet.
8.28.2
Deployment and direct benefit to citizens is not conditional upon government involvement. However, it is appropriate for
government to implement Australian Wisdom society wide. Government defines the rules of society and has a significant impact
on structure. It can legislate the stump jump plough (Industrial Economy) or the Combine Harvester (Network Society). Perhaps,
the time is right to structure society as networks given the recent drive to transform Australia. Government could transform
Australia very quickly. It will take decades for undercapitalised entrepreneurs to achieve the same outcome using a bottom up
approach.
Public Participation
There is another deployment option that may be more appropriate given the responsibility for Society is divided across
government departments (at federal, State and local levels). It may be simpler to just have one organisation like the DTO that
launches one network and make it directly available to all Australian citizens. However, it could also be done incrementally by
individual government departments. A Wisdom Network could be downloaded by anybody in Australia (just like Wordpress for
web sites) and deployed by the smallest or largest communities with a common interest. These individual communities then
mesh into the larger Australian Wisdom over time.
In this comment, we'll introduce an Australian people-driven society, provide a quick sector overview and then provide specific
wisdom networks that could be launched by various Australian government departments. Any of these could spawn or be part of
the Australian Wisdom Network. Without proactive action by Australian government, it will take decades for undercapitalised
Australian entrepreneurs and citizens to achieve the Network Society. With proactive action by the Australian government,
Australia could accelerate the inevitable evolution from Industrial Economy to Network Society and usher in a new era of
prosperity.
Society Growth is people driven by real-time citizen demand (citizen participation and contribution) in wisdom networks across
society
SOCIETY GROWTH IS PEOPLE DRIVEN BY REAL-TIME CITIZEN DEMAND (CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND
CONTRIBUTION) IN WISDOM NETWORKS ACROSS SOCIETY
The 'Industrial Economy' model for determining '(economic) growth' is planned and expanded by government and industry which
organises money, infrastructure, hierarchy, centralised decision making, annual planning cycles and markets to determine
society focus and expansion. The people in a Network Society drive Society Growth with real-time knowledge, planning, effort
and broad consensus captured and applied in all 'Community of Common Interest' wisdom networks across society. Priorities,
effort and outcomes are determined by real-time citizen activity across society in real-time networks.
8.28.3
8.29
8.30
8.30.1
Any individual could download and deploy a wisdom network in 90-180 days to focus wisdom to focus local, national or global
wisdom on community of common interest, society problem, need or challenge. Society Growth is dynamically with real-time
citizen demand for network features, sector, country, regional and global networks satisfied by any individual creating a wisdom
network in 90-180 days.
Entrepreneurs, governments, telcos and industry build a supply of wisdom networks that present the people and society with
opportunity for Society Growth. Wisdom Network demand (citizen participation and contribution) determines where society
expands by prioritising features, functions, wisdom and effort amongst competing local, sector, country and global networks.
The 3 parts of this discussion have been consolidated into the article "Our submission to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) team in the Australian Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet ... includes departmental recommendations" at
http://www.wisdom.to/ogpau . This articles may provide some formatting, extra images, and an Appendix of selected extracts
from the Australian Wisdom page ( http://www.wisdom.to/australia ).
Governments should be required to summarise in writing, with data, the reasons for what they are doing across as many areas
as possible - Government should not be "secret politician business". This would impose a discipline on the Government and
allow more people to engage in an informed way about Government decisions. We would be equipped to question our elected
representatives about what they believe in relation to specific issues that they have voted in favour of as a matter of
accountability and responsibility to us. When Governments enact legislation, they set their own goals re that eg compliance with
Human Rights Act or "financial implications". It would become a way of reflecting afterwards and ensuring they understood what
they were doing and why BEFORE hand!
Particiatory budgeting to allocate grant funding: Enable public participation in the allocation of funds to non-government
organisations through the use of participatory budgeting techniques. This would not only open government though public
participation and increased the transparency of these processes, it would also help to ensure that funds available are being
allocated to deliver public services and programs that the community value.
Note that this can be implemented in several ways.
1) Allocating a budget that community organisations could bid for, with a public assessment process and some form of voting on
which grants are provisioned. This may need the establishment of a platform for civic bidding (several open source ones exist),
which could be extended for state and local governments as a central capacity.

2) Pursuing a co-funding approach whereby agencies partner with a crowdfunding platform and nominate a program area.
Prospective grant recipients put their projects on the crowdfunding platform and must raise a certain proportion of their needed
funds from the public, at which point the government will provide a proportion. This approach has been used successfully by both
the Tasmanian and WA governments in the last few years. it requires less infrastructure provision by government and mitigates
some risk by demonstrating community support for the specific programs (through community crowdfunding dollars raised).
3) Providing funds to a third-party organisation which then manages the community-based participatory budgeting process. This
approach allows a specialist to manage the voting process and provides independence from government political processes to
create a perceptually fairer process and allows more expertise to be engaged in supporting the voting process (which is
important as the public is not commonly used to this approach). It does require careful selection of the third-party to ensure
perceptions of bias are minimised.
8.30.2
8.30.3 CORRECTION: Participatory budgeting relies on deliberation for its success. I.e. "Voting" (if required) is the end stage of a long Public Participation
process which draws people into exchanging views, values and ideas, better understanding each other and leading to better
developed policy, which may be agreed by consensus. There is now a wealth of experience of how to make this work well and
flaws to avoid.
A good starting point would be to require Federal MPs to use participatory budgeting techniques to decide on projects to be
funded under the "Stronger Communities Programme" ($150,000 per MP)
Public Participation
Thanks Craig and Ken, I love the way you have built on this suggestion. My vision is similar to the one I outlined for unsolicited
proposals. A combination between participatory and deliberative methods. That the allocation of funds be determined by three
levels of public participation: 1) public pitching / crowd sourcing of ideas or solutions (participatory and inclusive); 2) public
prioritisation through voting and discussion forums online using a set of criteria by a representative sample of the population
(representative - could be a jury); and 3) that the funds be issued by a citizens jury who cross checks the criteria against options
and reports back to the community. I don't mind the idea of crowdfunding as a way of boosting ideas / pitches - I think this should
be optional rather than a necessary part of the process.
8.31 Create a working group to devise better means of public participation. D. Public Participation
Public Participation
There are already some ways citizens can contribute to the democratic process. For example, there are opportunities for public
participation in some reviews, audits and parliamentary inquiries. This could easily be expanded.
8.31.1
8.31.2
8.31.3
Actionable 1: Form a working group to discuss areas in which it would be possible to involve public participation in policy
formulation to build upon those already available. This could be facilitated by opportunities to submit ideas regarding how
technology might assist in increasing public participation as well as any risk management aspects.
I have an action orientation and would need to see a clear framework under which this working group would be committed to
actual outcomes, not simply a report. Talk is easier than doing and it is preferable to pilot several different ideas cheaply than to
talk them out in a smaller circle of participants.
As Evelyn says, there are a range of ways in use; It is a matter of being familiar with them and selecting the best for each
particular matter. The newDemocracy Foundation <newdemocracy.com.au/> is one of several good sources.
o Lack of measure- how to evaluate and communicate the effectiveness of the changes
o Deliberate process- citizen juries/reference groups
o Technology needs to offer a great user experience- e.g. no point offering a portal for submissions if ‘citizens’ are not able to
submit successfully

peak body representing engagement professionals around the world. A number of key principles have been developed globally
that are recognised as best practice for engagement and public participation. IAP2 Australasia, is Australia and New Zealand’s
leading Association advancing the practice of public participation.
IAP2 was founded on the belief that those who are affected by decisions have the right to be involved in the decision making
process. Since 1998, IAP2 Australasia have been supporting people who implement public decision making processes by
offering training and resources and promoting the principles of community and stakeholder engagement.
We are well known for our Core Values, Code of Ethics for practitioners and the Public Participation Spectrum. In 2014 it was
recognised that the practice was changing and expanding to include community-led engagement and new tools and training
have been developed to meet this need. The communities of Australia want to have their voice heard more than just at election
time. IAP2 Australasia supports OGP in Australia for this reason and encourages all levels of government, and the private and
not-for-profit sectors, to embed engagement principles into the fabric of decision making processes.
Most recently IAP2 globally released the Quality Assurance Standard for community and stakeholder engagement, which can be
used to measure any community engagement process. We encourage any actions under OGP to consider and implement this
standard as the base or foundation framework. http://www.iap2.org.au/resources/quality-assurance-standard
IAP2 Australasia defines community and stakeholder engagement as a planned process with the specific purpose of working
across organisations, stakeholders and communities to shape decisions or actions in relation to a problem, opportunity or
outcome.
IAP2's core values define the expectations and aspirations of the public participation process - all 7 must be considered in any
engagement process. They can be found on Page 10 of the Standards above. Engagement practitioners agree to uphold these
values and code of ethics (page 9). Across Australia we are seeing a significant increase in government agencies agreeing to
these principles and undertaking training to ensure they can put these into practice.

The IAP2 Public Participation spectrum provides a quick reference to the levels of community engagement available to adopt. It
recognises that not every project will require intense collaboration and some will require more than information delivery. It is
about selecting the right level based on the needs/constraints of the decision maker and the potential impacts on stakeholders.
Though the Spectrum is presented as linear it is not designed to indicate that you should move along the Spectrum. Each
Action: Public participation champions
Public Participation
- Description: Conduct a brief review of successful government public participation activities to identify necessary and desired
skills and capabilities of high-performing communities. Key community representatives (members of the public not engagement
specialists) to be identified as champions for local areas to work with governments to raise awareness and build community
capability in engaging effectively with government. Additionally, governments would be encouraged to disseminate information
internally to build a partnership approach.

To open up government the Australian Government should embed in legislation a clear and defined process for use of randomly Public Participation
selected citizens to inform decision making around trade-offs, strategic planning, major policy initiatives or challenges where
there are a divergence of views and potential solutions.
This should be specifically applicable in areas where subjectivity (therefore distrust or fear of corruption) is a large factor.
This would improve the way Australia engages the full spectrum of its population in contentious issues, ensuring greater
transparency by increasing public participation.
This recommendation would provide a legislative platform for use of what are known as Citizens’ Juries. These juries are an
innovative means of involving everyday people in the process of government decision- making and are genuinely pioneering,
with each one acting as a practical example of open government in operation. Legislating for their use would enshrine the right of
citizens to deliberate on issues of real import; and would set a global benchmark for transparent and trust in government thereby
doing much to combat the cynicism and suspicion that is so prevalent in modern democracies.9.1 Establish or support ongoing spaces // events for industry, community and government to come together and work on solving

civic issues i.e. building civic technology, making budget data more accessible or testing viability of new technologies or
programs in government. Something like this: http://www.meetup.com/Civic-Lab-Melbourne/events/228102061/
Mechanisms to monitor and track progress: no. of gov, community and private sector participation, no. issues worked on, no. of
technology developed, no. of people learning new skills i.e. visualising data, no. challenges government puts forward to the
community
What organisations would be best placed to implement the idea: Code for Australia has been running a program to do this exact
thing in Melbourne. A similar space in other capital cities could be great.
9.1.1
9.1.2 Could be implemented in cooperation with civic societies or universities
Open Data Institute in the UK has run a highly successful challenge series, whereby social/economic/environmental challenges
are solved. Building on Code for Australia's idea, this is something that could be achieved locally in Australia
The link I created to the Open Data Challenge Series as mentioned above appears to have disappeared. Here it is:

It is often the case with many commonwealth and state government departments that customer service officers are not familiar
with their line of work, which in turn is an impediment to the efficient delivery of services. Lack of training may be one of the
causes. Pure incompetence may be another. In any case, this situation needs to be improved, not least because some of those
who are affected wouldn't even know they are! (ie. they are compelled to believe what they are told). Any ideas on how this
might be translated into an actionable and measurable commitment would be welcome.
Keeping and building on ‘corporate memory’
OGP Commitment activity suggestion
Need: Keeping and building on ‘corporate memory’
Activity to meet this need
Formal requirement for government staff, five years from retirement, to mentor younger employees for 12 months. Agreement of
the organisation, retiring employee and the younger employee that ‘shadowing’ is an important work task of both employees and
a formal part of their professional development. The basic process is below and this is expected to evolve through individual and
organisation involvement and need.
1. 'Shadow' a senior government employee (who has more than 15 years of government work experience) with the senior
employee purposefully showing and explaining their most valuable work tools and likely barriers;
2. Attend structured meetings to learn from the senior employees long-term lived experience of developing positive work
relationships, dealing with intricate organisational knowledge, managing transitions and agile change.

How it works
The mentoring program has rules and requirements similar to staff training but the content is the lived experience of the senior
staff member's work history. Particularly the technological, social, political, work/home balance and economic capital useful in
enabling more efficient organisation policies, plans and processes. This activity also refines career path planning and
professional development decisions. I strongly suggest that more places for females and minority groups be allocated to this
program to increase government staff diversity.
The benefit to the senior mentor includes reflecting upon new insights, perspectives, information offered by the younger person.
Noting when their work and life experiences are of benefit and can improve current and planned projects. Also, as the senior
employee retires, the organisation may decide to contract the retired person to ‘soft mentor’ senior executives.
Monitor and evaluate
Such employee interaction needs to be a work duty with details of how selection of mentor/mentee occurs, how work is planned
with privacy/confidentiality clauses, the means to review progress and ways to stop the interaction when required. Reporting on
the process is required at 3 month intervals. A common report is prepared as well as individual reports. Work completed during
these interactions will carry both people's names for transparent recognition and appraisal. An employee who has observed the
interactions is also required to evaluate the benefits, challenges and problems at 6 and 12 months.

This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the National Archives). The National Archives was established
by the Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it has existed in various forms since
the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in government through its
legislated role of setting records and information management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and preserving
and providing a public right of access to government information.
Open government increases the transparency and accountability of government, encourages greater public engagement,
strengthens governance and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key role in open government by
promoting the creation, management and preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information, and
facilitating access to this information.
The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and effectively covers all information created, used or received in
the course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) (Archives Act), the National Archives:
•identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
•preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth accessible;
•oversees Commonwealth records management;
•determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
•imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.
Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of
successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government policy. It is from this perspective and with this
legislated role that the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on the Vision and the framework for
the National Action Plan.
9.5
9.6
Vision
The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved management of, and accessibility to, information and
records. A key element of this is a move to fully digital information management and business processes across the Australian
government sector. This aligns with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the United States, Canada and
the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st century needs
to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a
number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading including earlier access to government records, the Digital
Continuity 2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.

PIAC - Recommendation regarding public service delivery: The following recommendations are drawn from the submission of
the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC) to this consultation. Many of these related to the pro-disclosure and release of
information that would assist in improving public service delivery:
Public Service Delivery
- PIAC recommends that a national consultation be undertaken to identify nationally significant datasets that should be prioritised
for public release. (Recommendation 6)
- PIAC recommends that the Commonwealth Government should consult with the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the insurance industry, consumer advocates and lawyers to identify
opportunities to make available actuarial and statistical data relating to mental illness. (Recommendation 7)
- PIAC recommends that that Council Of Australian Government Energy Council require that energy retailers report the
emissions intensity of all energy sales they enter into within the National Energy Market to supply customers. (Recommendation
8)
- PIAC recommends that the States and Territories be required to disclose the results of their audits of the energy efficiency of
their public housing stocks and the reports on the implementation of cost-effective upgrades. PIAC also recommends that
consideration is given to sourcing such information about residential tenancies and owner occupied housing and making it
publically available and accessible. (Recommendation 9)
- PIAC recommends that a wide-ranging consultation be undertaken to identify nationally significant datasets within the criminal
justice area. (Recommendation 10)
- PIAC recommends that the Australian Government commit to ensuring that state-based police forces, the Australian Federal
Police and any other relevant agencies be required to publish statistics regarding how many times Tasers have been used in the
jurisdiction, in all relevant modes, including the age and gender of the person on which it was used. (Recommendation 11)
- PIAC recommends that the Australian Government work with the states and territories to ensure consistent reporting regarding
self-harm incidents that occur in police and corrective services custody. (Recommendation 12)
- PIAC recommends that the Australian Government work with state and territory governments and relevant agencies to apply
the recommendations of the ERA (or similar measures) on a national basis across the corrections system. (Recommendation 13)
- PIAC endorses the recommendation of the Australian Human Rights Commission that the Australian Government should
expedite the ratification of OPCAT. (Recommendation 14)
- PIAC recommends that the Australian Government should encourage a culture of disclosure, with a specific focus on
departments engaging in national security or policing issues, at both a federal and state/territory level. (Recommendation 15)

Connected useful information: To open Government the Australian Government could release government- managed and
outsourced health and community services information through increased accessibility to both open and restricted data to drive
better ways to deliver services. There are examples of this overseas and in Australia (with the foundations already established)
Public Service Delivery
This would increase the transparency of government and promote the value of sharing information to deliver better outcomes for
the public.
Access to public information from different sources increases the opportunities for multi-disciplinary and cross-portfolio
approaches to address social problems
9.9 To achieve this:
Public Service Delivery
- need better data sharing (open data, interoperablity)
- develop single sign on, govt portal, that uses identity management - allows the individual to access information about
themselves, anywhere, anytime on any device. This would also allow govt to post specific information to individuals that are
relevant to them (could build on the My Gov system)
- specific projects in specific areas that identify (using data & qualitative methods such as ethnographies) to determine what
works, what doesn't, gaps etc and re-investment or reallocate money accordingly, and get out of initiatives that are not delivering
- co-design/co-create with local community based on above information
9.10 Create, manage and preserve information digitally to support transparency, accountability, citizen engagement and ongoing
access to, and re-use of, valuable government information: Commitment: The Australian Government will create, manage and
preserve information digitally to support transparency, accountability, citizen engagement and ongoing access to, and re-use of,
valuable government information.
Public Service Delivery
Meets principles: Transparency, Accountability, Public participation
Addresses Open Government Partnership Grand challenges: More Effectively Managing Public Resources
The creation, preservation and management of, and public access to, records and information is the cornerstone to transparency
and accountability in the Australian government. These records and information provide evidence of decisions and actions of the
Australian Government and are a unique source of information about the nature of the Commonwealth Government and its
activities. Without robust information management in government, there is no transparency or accountability, no evidence of
government decisions, and no protection of citizens’ rights and entitlements. Creating, preserving and managing these records
and information digitally not only supports business efficiencies but also encourages citizen engagement and timely access to,
and re-use of, Australian government information.
As the lead agency for information management in the Australian government, and the custodian of the most valuable
government records, the National Archives will continue to move Australian government agencies to digital information
management practices, implement strategies to support the ongoing preservation of, and timely access to, valuable digital
government information, and participate in legislative reforms to streamline access to government information by citizens.

Summary of Public Service teleconference 30/3/16. Seven people attended this call: Kevin, Maree, Ash, Des, Ken, Cameron and Public Service Delivery
I. We discussed actions suggested on this page. In response to the grand challenges / civic lab suggestion the group felt that
more data was required before these / and the effort contributed could be maximised. Civic spaces were discussed as physical
and online spaces and the need to leverage what's been done internationally and nationally was emphasised. The sustainability
and need for consistent funding of these kinds of initiatives was also discussed. Two-way mentoring, and the need for staff to be
given time to share lessons / build skills / have capacity for innovation was discussed briefly. The group felt a cultural shift would
be needed for the digital healthcare platforms suggested here, and that issues with the current e-health system should be
examined and addressed as this is explored further. The group largely supported API's, but felt a commitment and mandate
would be needed first with clear data standards and that their value should be determined before that commitment was made
(and evaluated) so they were sustainable. Amelia
The Australian government needs to deliver a simple, secure, inexpensive, and interconnected healthcare platform that enables Public Service Delivery
all stakeholders to coordinate effectively, regardless of their location/locale. This vendor neutral platform should enable auditable
collaboration across open, shared and linked data as well as permission-based cooperation around confidential data and
cost/service level transparency. Delivery of this platform will address the issues involved in providing an integrated healthcare
ecosystem to an ageing population across urban, suburban, rural and remote locations while also addressing the imperative to
lower costs and eliminate wastage due to systemic errors and inefficiencies.10.1
Improve public access to information and increase public participation: OGP category - Legislative Openness, Access to
Information, Open Data and Openness in Natural Resources areas
Resource Management
Suggestion:
To help better manage natural resources, the Government could improve transparency and community engagement by
proactively publishing useful information about extractive industry and energy projects. To make it easy for citizens and industry
to engage with natural resource development decisions, ensure open access to important information such as locations of
activities and environmental reports.
Successful implementation
This could be achieved by creating a single open, national platform for mining and resources project information that contains up-
to-date information about:
• the type of resource and project
• locations of proposed and current activity and infrastructure
• the decision-making process and applicable legislation
• status of projects
• links to public environmental and economic impact reporting
• company details
• links to community consultation events
Data and content on this platform will be available in a uniform, open, shareable format with permissible licences.
Context:
Most people don’t understand government and industry processes and rules. Information from government and industry is
siloed, lacks context and not written in plain english. Current delivery mechanisms rely on domain knowledge and specialised
software. Interrelated legislation is complex and varies by location. Company documentation and environmental reports are
difficult to access.
People feel they are not part of, and cannot contribute to, decisions relating to their community or projects of national
significance. When people do discover information either through the media or word of mouth, it is often too late to participate
and have an impact on decisions. Situations escalate and clashes occur.
10.2
Data management to assist Australia to meet its ‘Paris Agreement’ obligations: Executive Summary
Resource Management
There is a need to strengthen the amount and quality of information on climate change that is collected, published and monitored
for the Paris Climate Change Agreement. This is in harmony with Australia’s recent signature to the Open Government
Partnership (OGP) being a voluntary, multi-stakeholder, international initiative intended to “promote transparency, empower
citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance”. The OGP Agreement explicitly requires each
country to “co-create a National Action Plan (NAP) with civil society.” It follows that members of civil society including individuals
and climate action organisations are expected to contribute to the NAP.
To assess compliance with the Paris Agreement, Australia must produce and publish information on:
• what is being done,
• how well it being done, and
• what more needs to be done.
Lead Agency: Department of Environment
10.3
10.4
1) Justification
Australia and all other countries at COP21 (December 2015) committed to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. Fulfilment of the
provisions of the Agreement is necessary but not sufficient to avoid catastrophic climate change. The crucial importance of the
reduction in carbon emissions and the necessity of further action to keep global warming less than 20C above pre-industrial
levels, preferably no more than 1.50C, is clearly stated in the preamble to the Agreement itself (Appendix 1).
The Paris Agreement requires countries to create, collect and share knowledge needed to plan, implement and monitor action to
meet these global warming targets (Appendix 2). Australia, as one of the world’s leading sources of research and knowledge in
climate change, has both a domestic obligation and a duty to the international community to develop and use these resources for
the good of all.
Summary of Management of Resource teleconference 30/3/16. 10 people attended this teleconference: Ken, Kim, Michael,
Resource Management
Jessie, Ash, Brett, Mel, Mark, Tim and I. The group discussed the EITI, how it might be implemented by the Australian
Government and how it could improve transparency including disclosure of payments and company ownership, standards and
data release. This discussion included the need for legislative changes and a multi-stakeholder group / centralised approach to
meet EITI requirements. The group also felt that a centralised place for information about these kinds of resources and how they
were being used and managed across Australia was necessary and that companies might be encouraged or required to publish
data as well as open data from Government on this kind of platform. The group spoke to the need for increased access to open
data and data standards to enable this. Participants also spoke to the metrics and the need to look at more than those required
by the EITI/ transparency but also those that could support improved resource management in Australia and the measurement
and management of local social and environmental impacts. The importance of this data and these kinds of platforms for
transparency, to enable public participation and ensure accountability was emphasised. Amelia

temporary or permanent use of their properties and passageways for the purposes of CSG exploration and mining;
• A revision PETROLEUM (ONSHORE) ACT 1991 - SECT 47 ‘Application of Epis’, so that any holder of a Petroleum license are
subject to state or federal an environmental planning instruments as appropriate.
• The cessation of CSG development in populated areas.
• Cessation of CSG development in populated, prime agricultural and environmentally sensitive land and coastal areas until
effective and enforced regulation of this industry is introduced which ensures the long term, priority protection of the environment
and locally effected populations.

1.1," Treasury to share information for maximum public engagement. Reported in the Australian Financial Review on February 22: “Treasury will accept more external advice after a review identified economic forecasting flaws that led successive governments to spend big under the misapprehension of relentlessly strong resources-led growth.”
I have written about Treasury’s poor forecasting previously (here is a visual summary), and I agree with the AFR article: bad forecasting has led to bad policy.
Much is made of budget transparency, but little is made of forecasting transparency. The assumptions of Treasury should be open to the public. If Treasury will accept more external advice, it should not keep the information it shares with external parties confidential. Treasury should share its information openly for maximum public engagement in forecasting, rather than accept the biases of a few external parties.
Interestingly, the US has included participatory budgeting in its October 2015 OGP commitments. I am not advocating participatory budgeting, only participatory forecasting.

              ",Fiscal Transparency ,,
1.4.1,"This is a commitment in the UK National Action Plan 2013 to 2015. This would build on the current ASIC company registry, but would require the disclosure of beneficial owners, people who directly or indirectly own or control a company. It would need to be an offence for a person to register a company and not disclose the beneficial owners and an offence for a person to be a beneficial owner and not to have disclosed that fact. Shell companies with hidden ownership are used in a variety of transnational crimes, from tax evasion, to money laundering, to bribery to the financing of terrorism. The current ASIC database does not require the disclosure of beneficial owners, which has allowed front people to be used to hide the real owners of businesses involved in criminal activity. The UK Government revealed that 6,150 people currently act as directors of more than 20 UK registered companies, with some people being directors in over 1,000 companies. A research report by World-Check had previously shown that almost 4,000 people who are appear on various international watch lists are registered as directors of UK companies. 
This included 154 people allegedly involved in financial crime, 13 individuals wanted by Interpol for alleged terrorist activities and 37 accused of involvement in the drugs trade. No such data has ever been publicly disclosed for companies registered in Australia. 

Research by Findley, Nielson and Sharman also found Australian corporate service providers were near the top of corporate service providers in terms of being willing to set up an untraceable shell company even when there was significant risk the company in question would be used for illicit purposes. 

The World Bank and UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) published a report reviewing some 150 cases of corruption where the money from laundered. In the majority of cases: 
•    A corporate vehicle was misused to hide the money trail;
•    The corporate vehicle in question was a company or corporation;
•    The proceeds and instruments of corruption consisted of funds in a bank account; and
•    In cases where the ownership information was available, the corporate vehicle in question was established or managed by a professional intermediary.

In two-thirds of the cases some form of surrogate, in ownership or management, was used to increase the opacity of the arrangement.  In half the cases where a company was used to hide the proceeds of corruption, the company was a shell company.  One in seven of the companies misused were operational companies, that is ‘front companies’.
 
An OECD report into foreign bribery released in December 2014 found that in 25% of foreign bribery cases, the illicit money was channelled through shadowy secret companies. The report listed the ways law enforcement was tricked by “… subsidiary companies, local consulting firms, companies located in offshore financial centres or tax havens or companies established under the beneficial ownership of either the public official who received the bribes or the individual or entity that paying the bribes.” 

The ATO has publicly stated “Over a hundred Australians have already been identified involving tens of millions of dollars in suspected tax evasion through the use of ‘shell companies’ and ‘trusts’ around the world.” In October 2013, the Australian Federal Police charged three men with tax and money laundering offences involving $30 million. It is alleged they used a complicated network of offshore companies to conduct business in Australia while hiding the profits offshore, untaxed. The profits were then transferred back to Australian companies controlled by the offenders and disguised as loans so the interest could be claimed as a tax deduction. The level of alleged criminal benefit was estimated at $4.9 million. 

A public register of the ultimate beneficial owners of companies would be a significant step in addressing the risks raised by opacity of shell companies.

In a recent interview Detective Constable Mark Lugton of the UK Overseas Anti-Corruption Unit within the City of London Police said of public registers of beneficial ownership of companies: 

This is an excellent idea and has been lobbied for by law enforcement for some time. Clearly not being able to trace the real owner of a company is open to abuse, not only for bribery and corruption but also for other fraud offences. The idea that in this global market individuals can hide behind companies is no longer acceptable. This will obviously make the work of law enforcement that little bit easier at least within the UK and will provide a further hurdle for the criminal elements within business to jump over.

The G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brisbane in November 2014 took a small step forward in disclosure of beneficial ownership by committing to implement the G20 High Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency. 

Such a registry would benefit reporting entities under Australia's anti-money laundering and  counter terrorism financing laws, as it would make it easier for the reporting entities to know who they were dealing with, reducing the regulatory burden on them in establishing such information.

The World Bank and UNODC have stated their research:  …. finds that registries can usefully compliment anti-money laundering objectives by implementing minimum standards for the information maintained in the registry and by providing financial institutions and law enforcement authorities with access to adequate, accurate, and timely information on relevant persons connected to corporate vehicles – corporations, trusts, partnerships and limited liability characteristics, foundations and the like.",Fiscal Transparency ,,

Within this theme 5 categories of actions were discussed: 1) Transparent forecasting of budgets - revenue modelling and spending; 2) Campaign finance; 3) Ownership of companies; 4) Transparency of procurement and grants; 5) Performance indicators and reporting of program spending. I encouraged participants to connect their suggestions to the two Grand Challenges set by the Government and consider how they might be delivered as an OGP commitment. The OGP NAP template was shared as a guide. We also discussed the need for agencies will need to take on responsibility as lead agency for the delivery of actions and the need to cluster actions if we are to narrow them down to 5-15 commitments for the NAP. Some participants will now add their actions to other them to other theme areas to reflect connections to Grand Challenges and other actions suggested. A general overview of the event on the 11th April was provided including how actions outside the Grand Challenges would be dealt with - i.e. commitment templates would be developed and actions could still be pursued but they are unlikely to be included in the NAP. The question of budgets for delivery of OGPAU commitments was raised and budget cycles were discussed. Ongoing engagement among participants was encouraged - participants will comment on this wiki and consent was provided to share emails among the group. A follow up call for this theme will also be scheduled for next week. Amelia

1.8,"Participatory budgeting Participatory budgeting relies on deliberation for its success. I.e. ""Voting"" (if required) is the end stage of a long process which draws people into exchanging views, values and ideas, better understanding each other and leading to better developed policy, which may be agreed by consensus. There is now a wealth of experience of how to make this work well and flaws to avoid.
A good starting point would be to require Federal MPs to use participatory budgeting techniques to decide on projects to be funded under the ""Stronger Communities Programme"" ($150,000 per MP)",Fiscal Transparency ,,
1.8.1,"My views on participatory budgeting is that it needs to be prefaced by budget transparency. There is a great deal of obfuscation in public debate regarding government spending which can be addressed through supporting budget transparency projects both technically and financially. These projects require open budget data and also information regarding how funding flows to the states and local government. Comprehensive and accurate budget transparency projects need to be based on detailed understanding of the inner workings of how government administers funding, the kinds of questions that are not always addressed in public facing documents. I'm starting a list of these on GitHub for developers working on budget apps at https://github.com/forkinthecode/Budget-Transparency If you know the answers to the current questions - I'm all ears!

Breaking participatory budgeting down to specific programs is one way to avoid dealing with the bigger questions of where money is going overall geographically & politically however these are very important questions that attract the interest of the public, NGO's, media & government alike. 

The Commonwealth has done a good job with federal budget data both in opening it and receiving ongoing feedback as to how it can be improved however there is no infrastructure in Australia to fund these kinds of civic-lead projects that to be done properly require significant input of expertise, labour and public engagement. Such projects are not traditionally business oriented so unlikely to attract the interest of startup venture capitalists but the value of better analysis of spending patterns can not be overlooked.",Fiscal Transparency ,,

arguably would be useful to know. In the UK they introduced expenditure 
reporting per department monthly at https://data.gov.uk/data/openspending-report/index
2) A public register of all gov funded major projects (all types) along 
with status, project manager and regular reporting. This would make it 
easier to track major projects and to intervene when they are not 
delivering.
3) Update of PBS and Annual Report templates for comparative budget and 
program information with common key performance indicators and reporting

reporting in PDF documents that provide no easy way to compare outcomes,

common reports, comparative assessment would be easier and information 
about government as a whole much more available for assessment.

1.10,"Governments don't know how to buy free software. Despite open government policies highlighting benefits of open source software and open standards, government uptake 
of open source is surprisingly low. Why? Because government purchasing practices inadvertently favour proprietary software and vendor lock-in tactics over collaborative business practices used by open communities. There are multiple aspects to this, which should be understood, leading to updated guidelines to government purchasing practices. Some considerations include: How to compare long term value of open source and proprietary business models. How to assess the health of an open source community and associated rate of innovation in order to properly assess the value of open source.How to assess a product's claims of standards compliance. Some companies dissuade standards use by pricing extra for standards use, or limiting standards based functionality.How to assess the quality and applicability of a standard, and whether to invest in influencing the development of the standard.Typically government officials have mandate to solve department-wide problems, however open source and open standards based solutions will often be best justified at a Whole-Of-Government, or Whole-Of-World level. One particular argument is ""If I invest in an open standard, or open source, I will see minimal immediate benefit, but long term will see international adoption which will lead to advancement of my local goals.""Government's asymmetric spending of discretionary budgets at year-end disadvantages fee-for-service business models typically employed by open source businesses.",Fiscal Transparency ,,

The Australian Government will continue to play a role in transforming the transparency of global development assistance by publishing information on official development assistance (ODA) in line with the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard, so that Australian assistance can be tracked through the delivery chain.

1.12,"The government has been incrementally improving its public reporting. The Federal Budget papers and supporting are now made one the same evening or soon after thanks to the efforts of data.gov.au, and the ATO is publishing an extract of tax statistics several years after the year in question.
With regard to the expenditure reporting, the lack of standardisation of programme naming schemes, and machinery of government changes, makes it rather difficult to track expenditure across financial years. This is largely because it is reported at an aggregate level in the budget papers. Seeing as agencies have to track at a finer level of detail for the purposes of running the programmes themselves, they would have the information within their individual financial management information systems. All of this information would be passed between agencies as part of any Machinery of Government change, so the information is not lost. Perhaps as well as the budget papers, if agencies could report (at least at an aggregate / programme level) the level of expenditure (Capex and Opex) for each programme we would attain greater visibility to how each agency is delivering the programme. 
On the revenue side, the ATO captures all of the information, and seems to have internal processes to filter the data to protect the privacy of individuals prior to publication. It would be beneficial if that information on taxation revenue was available to the public sooner. In a perfect world, published at the same time as Final Budget Outcome (FBO).

2.1," Open up the procurement process to facilitate greater participation and public sector innovation
There's scope here to link the Government's OGP commitments to a new initiative in its National Innovation and Science 
Agenda, which states: “We will challenge small to medium enterprises to deliver innovative solutions for government, rather than tendering for an existing product.”

Opening up the procurement process in this way -- over and above mere transparency – will facilitate greater participation and public sector innovation. It requires a commitment to an open innovation model, replacing or expanding existing tendering systems with open innovation platforms. A culture of openness early in policy program development is needed; current procurement focuses on outputs rather than outcomes, with little early external participation to validate the appropriateness of the outputs.

Innovation Australia's 2014 submission to the Inquiry into Commonwealth Procurement Procedures articulated it this way: ""Agencies contemplating tenders should be required to give adequate notice of their intentions and take submissions regarding innovative possibilities.""",Fostering Innovation,,

Establish an open and transparent process to encourage unsolicited proposals from the public, business and industry. This would enable all levels of business to contribute not only ideas but infrastructure, services, and alternative business models to support the delivery of public services and infrastructure. The process could be made more open and efficient by: 1) creating an online platform to crowd source and encourage proposal pitching; 2) inviting public participation through a representative sample of the population who would be able to develop a criteria for evaluation and / or consider the proposals on an occasional basis / biannually or quarterly through a deliberative process that considers context, impacts, requirements to deliver and weighs up pros and cons of various options suggested. 3) A format or basic criteria for proposals and pitches so the public know what they can expect and proposals are well formed for consideration. 4) An internal taskforce to coordinate (and communicate) Government processes to enables the delivery of these proposals including transparent approval process, allocation of funding and other support mechanisms provided. This process could start small as a pilot with a stated quantity of funds and public resources allocated to invite and encourage proposals and a criteria establish to evaluate them. 
          ",Fostering Innovation,,
2.4,"Procuring innovation. To genuinely innovate the Federal Government should establish processes that enable collaboration inside and outside of the public sector, especially when problems are complex and input is required from non-government organisations to test understanding and explore potential impacts. To enable collaboration in these matters Government need to be able to procure services to co-design, prototype and test solutions when outcomes can not be known, and those involved need to provide fluid services. The responsive nature of this type of services design and solving problem makes it almost impossible for Government and its service providers to define exactly what will be required when the project commences. While it is commonly understood that this type of responsive service and collaboration is required, it is not currently possible to procure these types of services within traditional procurement models.  

Increasingly, and especially in the context of start-ups, small and agile innovators and innovative companies, Government need to be able to procure innovators, not innovations. The ability to more rapidly identify players - people and organisations - who not only ‘get it’ but have even a remote chance of 'getting it done’ in areas where new ideas, different approaches and genuine innovation is being sought is itself a key challenge. Agencies need scope to find and engage individuals whose experience, insights and approach make them ideal partners for  exploration phases, and when continuing and evolving innovation. 

Government also should consider supporting people and the organisations they need to involve when co-designing, prototyping and testing ideas and approaches. The current focus on procurement process, especially when innovative outcomes are being sought, can itself generate adverse outcomes in terms of efficiency, fairness and productivity. Asking people and organisations good at the new dynamic of design, rapid testing of multiple prototypes and eventual scaling of successful solutions, to bend their skills to participate in slower more cumbersome, complex and time consuming procurement processes is limiting the scope of providers and creative options available to Government. 

Perhaps there could be a different space seyt up adjacent to the more formal procurement process with clear expectations set (and adhered to) about the ability to play in the larger and more formal procurement processes when it comes time to buy a solution at scale.  This additional space would provide for the necessary legibility of process (who is involved, on what terms etc) while at the same time providing for more flexible and less onerous process provisions to nurture faster, more open and iterative conversations and exchanges.",Fostering Innovation,,
2.4.1,"I agree with this suggestion. 

The following is an expansion on the ideas and a possible action item for OGPAU.

It is difficult to introduce innovation into government or any large organization. Christensen described it in ""The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail"". What is true for commercial organizations is relevant to governments.

The best chance of government innovation is to leave existing systems as they are. Instead of trying to change existing systems keep innovation outside existing systems. But have ways to allow innovations to connect to existing systems. Existing systems can then evolve. The way we connect systems is the key to innovation adoption.

Innovation requires the participation of organizations who have the responsibility for ""business as usual"". They need to co-create the innovations with an eye to integration if successful. This co-creation should also involve the parties who are the beneficiaries of government services.

A dampener on innovation is the political process. Innovation requires a by-partisan approach. Keeping innovation out of the political process benefits all. Innovation and change is an ongoing process not a once off. It goes beyond the electoral cycle. Arranged well all parties can share in the credit and take no blame.

Within these constraints we can structure a process for innovation. A possible process may be along the following lines.

An innovation must be demonstrable ""in the small"". It must be something that will work with a few participants. This is Minimum Viable Product idea.

An innovation must integrate with existing systems without changing existing systems. This means systems are autonomous. Neither depends on the other.
An innovation is co-created. Possible participants are the proposers, agencies and the beneficiaries of the services.

An innovation must be able to show how it adds value to the community. Value extends beyond monetary measures. When realised the monetary value is available to fund future innovations. 

An innovation may be crowd funded. An innovation may be funded with private money.

If it is not adopted an innovation must have an exit strategy. The exit strategy must be blame free.

Governments have a process for unsolicited development proposals. Governments can use a similar mechanism for innovation proposals. Innovation proposals can come from private industry, government agencies, citizens or community organizations. Funding for future innovations can come from savings and income generated by innovations. 

Government will need to seed fund some of the first few innovations. There are low hanging fruit from organizations and people who have been storing ideas. These low hanging fruit, particularly ones that are crowd funded will soon generate funds. 

For OGPAU the government can commit to setting up a system for Innovations. The system itself can be one of its first innovations.",Fostering Innovation,,
2.5," Enabling place based reform through cross sector collaboration 
 The Federal Government should lead the collation of place-based data – both activity and outcome data – and support localised sense making.  Open data that builds understanding of the outcomes of citizens will create the enabling conditions for place based reform.  However, open data in itself is not enough.  Data needs to be shared in ways that are useable and easily consumable - preferably in visual form.  And further, the Federal Government needs to play a role in supporting sense making through analysis and dialog.  Place based reform is dependant on inputs and processes that build a shared understanding of complex problems and shared approaches to making large scale social change. 

Two live examples of the need for open data, that is citizen centred and visual is Maranguka's Justice Reinvestment Initiative for Bourke and Empowered Communities.  PM&C is involved in both the emerging initiatives.
Place based reform process will improve the delivery and cost-effectiveness of public services.  Localised change agendas - developed by all sectors - will guide the design and delivery of public services so they better meet local priorities, are more flexible and responsive, and are less duplicative and fragmented.  priorities, such as child development, poverty reduction, crime prevention, employment and housing.

The closed nature of the existing procurement panel process to get on a government supplier list, is an obstacle for government agencies being able to innovate, and find new service providers and SMEs to work with or collaborate with. 

The existing categories use old terminology and do not reflect contemporary roles and services. The government should open the lists and create new service categories to enable fresh people, ideas, approaches, and techniques. ",Fostering Innovation,,
2.10,"Addresses : Fostering Innovation, Access to Information, Public Participation, Improve Public Service Improvement and Delivery 

Commitment : Review the Australian Intellectual Property Rules with public and private sector participation. Create and publish useful, open and educational information for government staff, and service providers and citizens about where rules apply and where there are exceptions, particularly in relation to procurement. 

Context : 

The Australian Government position on IP can be confusing, is at times contradictory and can be easily misunderstood by internal government staff as well as external service providers. 

Across agencies and all levels of government across the nation different rules apply. There is a lack of consistency, transparency and explanation as to why there are different stances with regard to IP and copyright. 

For example - the default position for the Australian Government and NSW Government is that ICT providers and SMEs to retain their IP in order to benefit from their ideas and foster innovation. However, this seems to change between agencies and jurisdictions. It would be enormously helpful to provide clarity around IP and copyright to make it easier to do business with and collaborate with government. 

Suggestion:
It is the opportune time review this, provide frameworks and scenarios of best practices to complement the launch of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. 

This will help drive government and private sector innovation, encourage collaboration with government, researchers and universities. 

To help foster content innovation, a review of how Crown copyright is used and applicable, and a move to a creative commons licensing frameworks is required. Content should be able to be openly shared and reused, and where appropriate distributed through multiple channels to reach the broadest possible audience. 

This will encourage the uptake of creative commons, as well as provide opportunities to create an ecosystem of content innovators and the creation of original local content in collaboration with agencies and other organisations such as museums. 

Open source technologies and practices are now frequently used by service providers and government agencies. It would be good to provide best practices for the use of open source technologies, such as where agencies have used open frameworks and which licences are most appropriate. It will also provide the opportunity for a national discussion on how those inside and outside of government can create open source products and services, build sustainable businesses using open source technologies and creative commons licensed content. 

Implementation 
- Conduct a review of existing IP rules 
- Gather information from each agency on their IP policy and framework
- Conduct a national forum to discuss and agree on contemporary standards and create educational tools 
- Create a central place for each agency to publish their IP policy and frameworks 
- Create a place where details of open source technologies used and project case studies can be easily accessible and shared internally and externally.

Perhaps an Agency only version of the GitHub used by the DTO? This would help promote reuse within Agencies and allow the public service and its agents with a broader mechanism to solve challenges.

2.13,"Innovation requires the right environment. Innovative ideas that eventually turn into successful products, services or processes are rewarded in the private sector. However, in the public sector, it is usually a pat on the back- there is seldom any reward. If an idea fails in the public sector, the consequences are negative for everyone in that chain of command: negative press coverage, complaints from the public, questions about sensible resource utilisation... You can imagine the headlines in the newspaper! 
In a society that punishes failures disproportionately compared to rewards given to winners, innovation will remain stagnant. Let us call this the external innovation culture since it is external to the group that is trying to innovate.

The fear and reluctance for trying out new ideas is compounded in an environment where there is no profit motive. In an environment where status-quo is the norm, and management does not like to go out of its comfort zone, established norms or ways of doing things is not questioned, and anyone who does so is ignored, frowned upon or gently cast aside. I call this the internal innovation culture. This internal culture has to change to make governments more innovative, transparent and efficient.

Solutions

Changing the External Innovation Culture
Political consensus will greatly help soften external culture. If the major political parties are agreed upon trying out, for example, 20 new ideas at CentreLink, the risk of criticism towards the ruling government and department head would greatly be reduced even if half of them fail. If such a consensus is arrived at, accompanied by enthusiastic participation from civil society or groups, then the risk of negative media coverage will also be reduced. The overall winner would be an innovative public services.

Changing the Internal Innovation Culture
Hiring workers from outside the APS into all levels of the APS, particularly the higher EL1, EL2 and SES levels will infuse a new way of thinking. This can be done, for example, by including prominent players from the private sector in hiring panels of SES jobs. This will infuse new blood into the APS. Once we have people within the APS who think outside the box, who do not hesitate to be different and act different, they will innovate (or at least encourage and allow innovation by others). They will be less risk averse and more tolerant towards failures. They will provide innovative solutions to customers without customers having to come up with new ideas. The current system of a public service that is desensitised to public needs will change over time. 

Changing the internal and external innovation cultures will help citizens be served better, reduce corruption and lead to adaptation of new technologies and methods, thereby lead to a strong participatory democracy and improve transparency, This will in turn improve innovativeness.

""The FoI Act ushered in a new era of open government in 1982. Ever since, government in Australia has been more responsive, engaged and transparent. The Australian lead was followed in many other countries. And yes, the FoI Act is not perfect. It doesn’t balance well the administrative demands on government with the ideal of public access to government information. Many recommendations for reform have been made during the past five years by the OAIC and others. There has been scant government consideration of those proposals, at least outside the bunker.There is an urgent need for constructive debate on future directions in FoI. No political party can truly claim to subscribe to a policy of open government while this impasse continues.""

A wide range of experts outside government have serious concerns about the current state of the law and the practices adopted in many government agencies. The development of the national action plan provides the opportunity for discussion and debate about much needed reform.

The Centre for Law and Democracy (Canada) rated the Federal FOI act 51 of 104 right to information laws reviewed, awarding 83 points out of a possible 150. Since that assessment the Government announced its intention to abolish the Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). If the bill, still before the Senate, passed into law a further drop in international standing would follow.

Serious consideration of other reforms will be constrained while the Government maintains its position that the OAIC should be abolished and in the meantime that funding for the office notextend to the full range of its functions.

Recommendations put forward but not discussed “outside the bunker” to use Professor McMillan’s words, include those contained in the Australian Law Reform Commission 2009 report Secrecy Laws and Open Government; the report by Dr Allan Hawke following his independent statutory review of the FOI and Australian Information Commissioner acts in 2013; reports by the Australian Information Commissioner; criteria published by the Centre for Democracy used in its international RTI Index; the Global Principles on National Security and the Right to Information (Tshawne) principles; principles published by Article 19 (The Public’s Right To Know: Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation); issues raised in policy papers published by Transparency International Australia and in submissions to the OGP NAP process by acknowledged experts such as Professor Moira Paterson and Dr Johan Lidberg.

Dr Hawke recommended a comprehensive review of the kind he did not undertake and noted a call from the Law Council of Australia that a complete rewrite in less complex language is long overdue.Issues canvassed canvassed include: modernisation of the act which with its focus remaining since 1982 on written documents rather than information held in digital form; the limited pro-active release and publication requirements which for example do not incorporate grants,contracts, gift registers and data sets; no legislated requirement to publish and provide access to information and data in machine readable formats; exclusion from the act of the parliamentary departments as a result of legislation passed in 2013; provisions regarding access to information held by contractors with rights of access limited and reliant on contract provisions but no remedies if the contract is silent on access to information in the hands of the contractor. In the light of contracting out and privatisation trends the FOI act should be extended to organisations funded by government and those that carry out public functions; the absence of a single government wide access portal for making applications; equitable fees and charges; improvements to the process for review of agency decisions that promote efficiency and effectiveness while preserving the role of the independent watchdog and advocate of open government that provide other options that go beyond the current government preference to abolish the OAIC; exemption provisions that do not properly balance the sometimes competing interests of government and the public interest in access by citizens.

The right to access to government information still encounters strong resistance in some areas of government despite attempts over 30 years to promote culture change, highlighting the need for a renewed effort to encourage more open and transparent government and more collaborative approaches to policy development.",Freedom of Information,,

As a number of others have proposed the Government should withdraw the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill which has been before the Senate since October 2014 and not brought on for a vote because it does not enjoy majority support. In the meantime reduced funding for the OAIC has meant the office does not carry out some functions conferred on it by Parliament and has a limited capacity to carry out others. As Dr Lidberg's research identifies, cultural change in the direction of openness and transparency is more important in achieving the objectives that underpin freedom of information than changes to the law, but clearly culture and a modern well balanced law that reflects Australian and international good practice are both important. Australia cannot credibly support the OGP and explore reforms on the home front to advance transparent open government and increased citizen participation while planning to abolish the office of information commissioner, the body established by parliament to play a key role in advancing those same objectives.",Freedom of Information,,
3.5,"Amendmends to FOI laws- Based on the article and my other research (2001-2016) here are my recommendations re information access in Australia’s OGP national plan in dot points.
•    Culture change of the administration of FOI is more important than legal reform and change. Put more effort into FOI guidelines issued fromministers and heads of department – see the WA example in the article. These guidelines should make it clear that the task of public servants is to facilitate FOI requests and that a fast as possible processing time should be a priority.
•    Re-fund the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Re-appoint the Information Commissioner and FOI Commissioner.
•    Aim to change the current ‘pull’ information culture to a ‘push’ one. All information should be considered public and the public servants  should have to justify why a generated document should not be public.

Legal reforms:
•    Amend FOI laws to include a FOI/Information Commissioner in all Australian jurisdictions modelled on the OAIC
•    Implement the FOI disclosure logs across all FOI jurisdictions and task the FOI/Info commissioner with following up the implementation and use of the disclosure logs. ALL 
•    Scrap the $30 FOI request fee – it sends the wrong signals.
•    Introduce a public interest request category – if the request qualifies in this category – processing fees should not be charged. The default should be not to charge fees.
•    Amend the FOI laws in all Australian jurisdictions to include all government agencies modelled on best practice legislations in countries like Sweden and the US where no government agencies are exempt. Exempting agencies signals secrecy instead of transparency. Documents from security agencies may be redacted, but it is an important step in changing the administrative culture from secrecy to openness.",Freedom of Information,,
3.6," Transparency on customs data. Follow the example of other countries, such as the US and India, and make customs data publicly available, so that government is not hiding where companies are sourcing products from. Making key data about imported products publicly available would allow greater ability to detect where Australian importers are dealing with suppliers where there is the presence of criminal activity, human rights abuses and/or unlawful environmental destruction and the source jurisdiction has failed to take effective action to stop the criminal abuse. This would have a deterrent impact on the risks Australian importers are willing to take in dealing with suppliers where there is significant risk of criminal activity and human rights abuses being present, out of concern of reputational risk.

Currently information about imports is recorded through the Australian Government’s Integrated Cargo System (ICS) and includes the type of product, quantity, the supplier and the recipient. In other jurisdictions, including the United States, the EU and India, this data is made publicly available. However, import data collected through Australia’s ICS is not made public. Limited statistical data from ICS is made available to the Australian Bureau of Statics for research purposes. 

In the jurisdictions where customs data is publicly available there is no evidence of any significant impact on commercial activities or the proper functioning of markets. There is evidence that it has assisted importers in those jurisdictions to be made aware of risks of human rights abuses and criminal activity in relation to suppliers they are sourcing from.

Actionable 5:  Centralise the FOI disclosure logs to one site with each agency can access using their own password for uploading documents.  A user-friendly search function using keywords would harness documents from a number of different agencies on a particular topic. This would aid in academic research as well as expanding information available for citizens to make informed choices.  It also would reduce pressure on FOI if information is easily sourced.

Information access evolution – assessing Freedom of Information reforms in Australia

Abstract
The last seven years have seen major reforms of half the Freedom of Information (FOI) laws in Australia. This is the third article in a series investigating the reforms. The first paper mapped international evolution of FOI (Lidberg, 2013) and the second described a pilot study of Australian FOI reforms (Lidberg, 2015).

The question posed in this article is; have the Australian FOI reforms made a difference in practice? To answer this question a participatory observation study was designed and information sought using Australian FOI systems comparing the FOI 1.0 “pull” FOI jurisdictions with the reformed FOI 2.0 “push” systems. A diary method was employed and the findings indicate that some new generation FOI regimes deliver better and faster access to information, while some non-reformed systems performed on par with the updated ones. The results pointed to great discrepancies between agencies in how the information was made available. Accountability theory was used to analyse and discuss the findings.

THIS IS THE DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Discussion
Table one indicates that the push systems are useful insofar as FOI requests previously processed are published on some websites. The comprehensiveness of this publication varies between departments and jurisdiction. According to FOI commissioner guidelines (OAIC, 2015a) such publications should be done in the so called disclosure logs, but, as illustrated in table one, this is not always the case, which is confusing from a user’s point of view. 

In all cases – including Queensland and NSW – the diarist was told by FOI officers that it was necessary to lodge FOI requests to get details of the Premiers’/Chief Minister’s expenses. 

This raises questions about whether the so-called “push” systems are operating efficiently. The FOI officers in Queensland and NSW should have been able to direct the diarist to the voluntary disclosure links on the respective websites from the outset. In NSW, It took more than two months until the FOI officer informed the diarist that most of the information requested in the FOI application was already available on the DPC website.

A few of the states, including WA and SA, publish quarterly reports on international travel expenses for all ministers. In addition to international travel expenses, the WA site also publishes interstate travel expenses for all ministers. The frequency of these disclosures in these “pull” states is actually more fine-tuned than in “push” jurisdictions.

No state or territory government volunteers expense data for intra-state travel. 
This is significant because one would expect local travel to account for the bulk of taxpayer-funded travel of state and territory Premiers and Chief Ministers.

The South Australian and Queensland FOI officers warned the diarist that the wording of the FOI requests would likely require “many hours” of research across different departments incurring a significant processing fee.

A similar warning was issued by the NSW FOI coordinator. It turned out that most of the requested information was already in the public domain but not discoverable without the assistance of the FOI officers.

This indicates that systems for managing ministerial expenses in these states was less centrally managed or controlled. It might also indicate that FOI officers are not adequately trained to service requests from applicants.

The project highlighted another important variable in comparing the FOI processes in each of the jurisdictions: the reliance of FOI users on the goodwill and competence of FOI officers for making the requests bear fruit.

Queensland and the ACT lead the way on “push” model disclosure among the seven jurisdictions investigated. The archived disclosures make comparison possible and potentially function as a discipline on ministers to curb wasteful spending. The fact that the spending of ministers will be disclosed creates a reputational incentive for politicians to embrace thrift and restraint. 

A critical feature of disclosures made under “push” systems is standardisation of disclosures. In Queensland and the ACT it is possible to establish historical patterns for ministerial expenses and therefore to determine whether the most recent disclosure of a minister deviates from trend. Push systems are designed to compare apples with apples. This is less feasible under “pull” systems because disclosures, by definition, are prepared on an ad hoc basis. In other words, pull systems yield disclosures that make comparison difficult.

While Queensland and the ACT have embraced the idea of standardised and systematic disclosure, several “pull” states – WA and SA – each systematically disclose international travel expenses of ministers. In this sense, they could be seen as near-hybrid systems. 

The overarching conclusion of the findings is that some reformed 2.0 systems, namely NSW and Tasmania, still in practice operate a 1.0 systems, whereas the ACT, a 1.0 law, displays mainly 2.0 properties. WA with its quarterly pro-active systematic disclosure of the bulk of ministers’ travel expenses can be seen as a hybrid system displaying both 1.0 and 2.0 properties. SA and NT are clearly operating as 1.0 systems.

To this can be added the findings from the initial study comparing the state of Victoria (VIC) and the federal law. The conclusion here was that Victoria is a 1.0 regime and that the Commonwealth system presented very clear 2.0 properties leading to much higher functionality compared to VIC (Lidberg, 2015).

Table two summarizes the findings in both studies outlined above.

Jurisdiction Type of FOI law Functionality
Australian Capital Territory 1.0 2.0
Commonwealth (federal) 2.0 2.0
New South Wales 2.0 1.0
Northern Territory 1.0 1.0
Queensland 2.0 2.0
South Australia 1.0 1.0
Tasmania 2.0 1.0
Victoria 1.0 1.0
Western Australia 1.0 Hybrid - traits of both 1.0 and 2.0

Two positive developments should be noted. In a similar study in 2003-2004 the Prime Minister’s expenses for 2002/2003 where sought. They were not disclosed and the information access process stopped when the Department of Prime Ministers and Cabinet estimated the processing cost to $963 (Lidberg, 2009). In the studies described above, information was released or already available and no processing fees were charged.

In all cases but Queensland the turn around time went the full 30 business days (the maximum time stipulated in FOI laws) and in a few cases well beyond the allowed time with SA taking the prize with 112 days. Turnaround time has been and still is one of the greatest weaknesses of the Australian FOI systems.

Based on tables one and two it seems clear that the findings in the last two studies reiterates the importance of the administration of FOI and the attitudes of administrators toward information access. Similar findings can be found in earlier studies (Snell, 2004; Solomon, 2008). A prime example is WA where an active FOI Commissioner has, at least to some extent, managed a culture change in how FOI is administered that appears as effective as legislative changes. 

This can be compared to Victoria where a FOI Commissioner was recently appointed and FOI professional guidelines published. Thus far this seems not to have had the same effect as in WA.

From an accountability perspective it appears that enough information was obtained in the described studies to achieve some level of governance accountability. In the terms of Bovens et al (2008) the forum obtained enough information to ask questions about how the Premiers and Chief Ministers have used taxpayer money for their travel and other expenses. The possible consequence for misuse of public funds could be that voters decide to not vote for the minister in the next election. With this outcome in mind the FOI laws assessed in this study appear to deliver according to the accountability framework base line.

However, one crucial issue remains – the information is made available/released by those that are to be held to account. How do you as a FOI user know that the information acquired is comprehensive? The answer is – you do not. From an accountability point of view this is the greatest weakness in all FOI systems. FOI has always been, and will most likely remain, an accountability tool ultimately controlled by governments – it is an internal accountability system. Given this weakness in the system FOI regimes need to be complemented by potent protection of whistle blowers who decide to make public maladministration and corruption via media. It could be argued that FOI and whistle blower/protection of journalistic sources are different sides to the same coin. Previous studies have showed how far-reaching FOI regimes and journalistic source protection function as very effective accountability agencies (Lidberg, 2009; Przeworski, 1999). Although so called shield laws for journalists (amendments to evidence acts that may, in some circumstances, allow journalists to not disclose anonymous sources as part of court proceedings) have been introduced in most Australian jurisdictions, we have yet to see them work in tandem with journalistic use of FOI in Australia.

Anarchic information access agents such as WikiLeaks and Anonymous can be described as external actors that circumvent the internal information access systems. They have already proven to be effective, but it remains to be seen how influential they will become as accountability agents. Researchers are divided on this issue (Roberts, 2012).

Conclusion
This article has described the result from a nationwide comparison of first and second-generation FOI laws. The question posed was if the reformed FOI laws provided faster and easier information access compared to the first generation laws. To answer the question information regarding the expenses for Premiers and Chief Ministers in Australia for the 2011/12 financial year was sought.

The findings indicate that some reformed 2.0 FOI systems do indeed deliver faster and easier information access, while some 2.0 laws in practice still function as 1.0 systems. The most interesting result from the study is that some first generation laws, in particular WA, have managed to transform into pro-active disclosure without legal reform. This supports the trend observed in earlier studies that cultural and attitudinal change among those administrating the FOI law is as important as legislative change when jurisdictions seek to make FOI systems function more effectively in practice.

Such cultural change appears most effective when driven from the top. An illustration of this is the deep legal and cultural reforms to Commonwealth FOI implemented between 2008 and 2013. As mentioned above these changes saw the creation of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Although progress was slow, there were clear indications that the federal system was improving. Progress stopped when the Abbott government attempted to cut funding to the OAIC in its first budget and to transfer much of its functions to the Attorney General’s department. The consequence was that the federal FOI commissioner quit and was not replaced. The funding cuts did not pass the senate and the FOI part of the OAIC operated under great uncertainty during 2014. At the time of writing the OAIC ‘has received transitional funding of $1.7 million for 12 months pending the implementation of the Government’s measure “Smaller Government — Privacy and Freedom of Information functions — new arrangements” (OAIC, 2015b). This does not indicate a government committed to and prioritising information access.

If the ‘smaller government’ proposal is implemented it is highly likely Commonwealth FOI will return to a pre 2010 situation with poor functionality. This is very unfortunate, as the FOI systems in Australia will then have lost its leader. Further FOI functionality studies of the federal system are needed post these changes (if implemented) to determine if this is the case.

On a global scale future research into how and if FOI could be extended to cover the private/corporate sector is needed. Currently public access to corporate information is extremely poor, yet large corporations at times have as much influence over our daily lives as do governments (Achbar, 2003). One is left to wonder if the nature of the toxic collateralised debt obligations (CDO), at the core of the global financial crisis, had been made public earlier would the GFC been as severe? Could it have been limited if the use of CDOs had stopped earlier?

These measures may include:

Applicant by type
Application rates per capita
Reviews as a % of application numbers
Release rates
Refusal rates

The development and collection of data to inform an assessment of the utilisation of information access rights within Australian States and Territories is unprecedented. The metrics will assist in building a more complete picture of open government, with a focus on use of traditional and established 'pull pathways' to access information rights. Benefits include increasing awareness and transparency of citizen activation of these rights to access government information, together with a comprehensive quantitative data set to use as a baseline for future evaluation. This baseline and the assessment approach more broadly may be applied to contribute to the overall assessment of Australia's Open Government National Action Plan.

- PIAC recommends that the Government implement the following recommendations of the Hawke Review: 
• certain agencies should be required to justify their complete exemption from the FOI regime to the Attorney-General within a twelve-month period (Recommendation 19);
• the Act should be amended to provide that the Information Commissioner can declare requests to be ‘vexatious requests’ rather than empowering the Information Commissioner to declare applicants to be vexatious applicants (Recommendation 32); and
• FOI applicants should have a period of exclusivity with documents they have requested before those documents are publicly released (Recommendation 37). (Recommendation 3, PIAC submission)",Freedom of Information,,

A consistent reporting approach and public access to details of outsourced contract work with greater consistency of confidentiality rules in procurement. A lot of work is outsourced by government to third parties. This can be a good way to deliver some things (and there are many arguments as to how much outsourcing is too much) however, it introduces a serious transparency issue when the information about contracted work is unable to be monitored, with the excuse of ""commercial in confidence"". All contracts should have minimum reporting requirements and should make publicly available the details of what exactly is contracted, with the exception of contracts with national security where such disclosure creates a significant risk. This would also help in creating a motivation for contractors to deliver on their contractual obligations. Finally, if procurement officers across government had enhanced training to correctly apply the existing confidentiality test from the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, it would be reasonably to expect that there would be less information hidden behind commercial in confidence.(Full blog post on my personal submission at http://pipka.org/2016/03/28/my-personal-ogpau-submission/)",Government Integrity,,

Ensure that parliamentary integrity provisions are in line with international better practice Justification: Members of Parliament are public officers and as such must put the public interest ahead of all personal and other private interests. Unethical or corrupt behaviour is incompatible with their entrusted responsibilities and undermines and detracts from their performance of their parliamentary duties and hence the performance of their parliament.
Australia recognised this when it pledged to support the Harare Commonwealth Declaration 1991. The Declaration provided (amongst other things) for Commonwealth countries:
“to work with renewed vigour, concentrating especially in the following areas:
· the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values of the Commonwealth;
· democracy, democratic processes and institutions which reflect national circumstances, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, just and honest government.”
That pledge clearly indicates that the democratic system, of which Parliament is the peak institution, should function according to the rule of law, justice and honesty.
More recently, international standards for parliaments were established by the Recommended Benchmarks for Legislatures, adopted in 2006 by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the UNDP andthe World Bank. The recommendations include:
10. Ethical Governance
10.1 Transparency and Integrity
10.1.1 Legislators should maintain high standards of accountability, transparency and responsibility in the conduct of all public and parliamentary matters.
10.1.2 The Legislature shall approve and enforce a code of conduct, including rules on conflicts of interest and the acceptance of gifts.
10.1.3 Legislatures shall require legislators to fully and publicly disclose their financial assets and business interests.
10.1.4 There shall be mechanisms to prevent, detect, and bring to justice legislators and staff engaged in corrupt practices.
Each House of Parliament should adopt its code of conduct independently as each is autonomous from the other House. Neither House of the Parliament of Australia has adopted a code of conduct.Comparable parliaments, such as the UK House of Commons at Westminster and the Canadian House of Commons, have well-established and highly developed integrity systems including codes applying to their Houses and Members of Parliament.
However, codes of conduct and like instruments (e.g. code of ethics; conflcit of interest code) do vary widely in their provisions and effectiveness. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association commissioned Recommended Benchmarks for Codes of Conduct Applying to Members of Parliament, published in 2015. These recommendations specify the principles that should be incorporated in a code of conduct and complementary provisions, having regard to local circumstances e.g. the size and resources of the parliament.Recommendation: That
The Government lead the development and adoption of a Parliamentary Integrity System, including a code of conduct for each of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Each code of conduct will be based on the Recommended Benchmarks for Codes of Conduct Applying to Members of Parliament. In developing each code, regard be had to the equivalent parliamentary 
integrity system, including codes, of the UK House of Commons and the Canadian House of Commons and the National Integrity System in which each is embedded.

4.7," Government openness - efficiency and effectiveness Lack of openness means that those parts of the public that must comply with government direction do not have a full understanding of what they are supposed to do or why they are doing it. Lack of compliance leads to enforcement actions that are expensive.  Some of these would be unnecessary if the government told people what they needed to know.
Lack of openness leads to sloppy and incompetent decision making within government because undisclosed processes are not open to question and therefore not open to correction.  This disconnects the government from the population.  It also starts to erode the government's wisdom as this disconnection limits learning.  Eventually, the government is sufficiently disconnected from reality to be unable to govern  properly because lack of openness includes lack of effective feedback.  Thus, without accurate information on what is happening, poor decision making on the information available and inability to effectively harness the people to act in a timely manner the government stops being able to respond to events in real time.  This is rarely good for a governments continued existence.  It could be argued that openness is a method for staying in power.

4.7.1," Very true. Some government departments, however, do not usually need to respond to events in real time, but just provide services and make decisions on a ""one to one"" basis. Openness to them, is about having to be accountable. By keeping their processes undisclosed (and quite often undefined!) and their clients in the dark, they do not have to operate to the same level of accountability, which means lesser costs (untrained/ improperly trained staff, outdated systems, no feedback mechanisms) to them but higher economic and emotional costs to the community. Also note that there is at least one commonwealth department whose clients are predominantly non-citizens who do not have a say in the democratic process! My point is, it is not always in the government's interest to be open, which is why active campaigning is always necessary.

4.8,"Network Democracy (http://www.wisdom.to/networkdemocracy ): restoring the balance with real-time, comprehensive citizen participation across government, democracy and industry / part of Australian Wisdom ( www.wisdom.to/australia)
Network Democracy ( http://www.wisdom.to/networkdemocracy ) is a sub-set of Australian Wisdom. Please see Australian Wisdom submission on 'Public Participation' theme page and http://www.wisdom.to/australia .

One network could provide comprehensive citizen participation, governance, transparency, wisdom and access to government and industry. Stage 1 would deliver Government Wisdom with a specific focuson collective governance. Stage 2 could deliver broader citizen participation. Stage 3 could deliver build on collective government wisdom and include the democratic process. Additional stages could include industry/sector governance and other aspects of society.
The article explores 4 opportunities for real-time, comprehensive citizen participation in society:
- Government Wisdom: government reduced to “things” in the Internet of Everything. It provides a more efficient and effective means to organise government. It also facilitates transparency and accessibility to every “thing”.
- Citizen participation (or Wisdom): Government Wisdom provides the means for “active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life. Citizens and the community have access to every “thing” in real-time. The initial focus could be governance, decision-making and financial financial “things” across government departments and agencies;
- Democracy Wisdom: real-time distributed community participation, contribution and governance across the process of democracy
- Governance wisdom (industry): this provides the means of distributed community participation, contribution and governance across industry participants. Community review could ensure communityinterests are also considered.
Government Wisdom is a subset of Network Society. presents an opportunity to achieve a rapid increase in productivity, accessibility, transparency, accountability (including reducing corruption) and citizenparticipation in Society. The focus within this article is government governance, decision-making and collaboration.
Government Wisdom comes “Over the Top” and links to governance “things” within the Internet of Everything (IoE) across government departments and agencies. It acts as an aggregator of information, but also reveals knowledge and coordinates action toward outcomes. All “things” that embody government can be defined in a single page. Everyone, anywhere can access every “thing” within government.
Every aspect of government can be reduced to things and books. Things across can be combined into books in an exponential number of ways for multiple purposes. Things can be combined in dynamic ways in unlimited combination. You can see how things are connected. This means that knowledge and outcomes can be achieved by simply creating, viewing or things on mobile devices.
The government is reduced to things and books which can be shared with other bureaucrats and citizens. With every thing accessible to everyone everywhere, there is a profound impact upon productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, participation within and beyond government.
Government Wisdom would allow anyone to participate and contribute to any “thing”, any where in real time. This includes all “things” in government. This might be government governance documents (meetings, resolutions, policies). It could also be “things” outside of government in the community. Citizens could create a ""thing"" that refers to a hole in the road and assign a tasks to a local council maintenance person.
Collective government wisdom (government wisdom and citizen participation) can also be extended to democracy. Our society does not facilitate “the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life”, but it can. Democracy is batch processed in which representatives are elected and are then responsible for decisionsuntil the next election. If real-time active participation was facilitated, then it is likely that “the active participation of people,as citizens, in politics and civic life” and encourage or enforce a society “in which laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens”.
The outcome would be a Shift from Industrial Democracy which enables citizens to vote once every few years, to Network Democracy (or Democracy Wisdom) that allows citizen to vote every day on every thing. Citizen Participation would move beyond a vote between 2 political parties to participation, contribution and participative decision-making across any “thing”, every day.

4.9,"Ensure that parliamentary openness procedures are in line with international good practice. This suggestions builds on Henare's intial suggestion of ""Endorse the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness.'
Parliaments must constantly renew their commitments to transparency and citizen engagement. Due to the rapid pace technological change, there’s a need clear for periodic reviews of policies that influence parliament’s ability to engage; and it is often helpful to institutionalize this process for periodic review. The Declaration on Parliamentary Openness states that “Parliamentary transparency policies shall be publicly available and shall specify terms for their periodic review to take advantage of technological innovations and evolving good practices.” As early as 2004, the conclusions of a 2004 Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and World Bank Institute study group on access to information noted that “[c]onsideration should be given to regular parliamentary review, for example on a biannual basis, of implementation of the access to information regime.” (Mendel, 2005). The Global Centre for ICT in Parliament (2010) has also established that parliaments should elaborate “strategic plans, updated regularly, for the use of ICT that directly improve the operational capacity of parliaments to fulfil their legislative, oversight, and representational responsibilities.”

Recommendation - Institutionalize a regular legislative openness review, in the rules of procedure or in other procedures and practices that involve the participation of local civil society experts, leading to both changes in policies and potential commitments.Actively engage with the government in the development of parliamentary openness commitments in future OGP action plans; either fully integrated intothe countries action plan or as a separate appendix, focused solely on the legislature.Conduct a parliamentary information audit to ensure that necessary information is made available in accordance with international good practice.Form or formally task a committee or other body within parliament to monitor parliamentary openness and citizen engagement efforts.Engage in international fora dedicated to sharing international good practice, including the OGP Legislative Openness Working Group, to actively learn from other peer institutions regarding emerging best practice on parliamentary openness.suggested and open for further discussion at https://forum.opengovernment.org.au/t/open-parliament/18/3",Government Integrity,,

4.13," Private Sector Whistleblower Legislation. Deliver legislation to protect whistleblowers exposing fraud, corruption, tax evasion and tax avoidance in the privatesector, to match legislation to protect whistleblowers in the public sector. The protection of whistleblowers is specifically in the Open Government Declaration under ""Implement the highest standards of professional integrity throughout our administrations"". 

Research by the Australian Institute of Criminology (Australian Institute of Criminology, Fraud Against the Commonwealth 2010-2013, Canberra, July 2015) found that over the 3 years between 2010 and 2013, there were at least 265,866 incidents of suspected fraud reported by Commonwealth entities.
- Each year, substantially greater numbers of external fraud incidents were detected than suspected internal fraud incidents.
- Fraud involving financial benefits was the most frequently reported category of external fraud.
- Over the 3 years, the number of fraud-related corruption increased substantially from 37 incidents in 2010-2011 to 163 in 2012-2013.
- While the cost of this fraud is hard to quantify and figures may vary, a conservative estimate is approximately $530m over 3 years, with increases from $119m in 2010-2011 to $204m in 2011-2012 to $207m in 2012-2013.
- Over the 3 years, external fraud accounted for $521m while internal fraud amounted to $9.1m or 1.7% of the total reported fraud losses.
In relation to external fraud:
- risks arise in connection with the provision of new benefits, the introduction of new taxes, procurement practices, government-funded programs and the use of consultants; and
- the relationship between corruption and collusion between external actors and those public servants working within government.
The legislation to protect private sector whistleblowers should be based on the recommendations of the Senate Economics Committee report ‘The performance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’.
The Senate Economics Committee report on ASIC recommended (Recommendation 15):…protections for corporate whistleblowers be updated so that they are general consistent with and complement the protections afforded to public sector whistleblowers under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013. Specifically, the corporate whistleblower framework should be updated so that:
•    Anonymous disclosures are protected;
•    The requirement that a whistleblower must be acting in ‘good faith’ in disclosing information is removed, and replaced with a requirement that a disclosure:
o    Is based on an honest belief, on reasonable grounds, that the information disclosed shows or tends to show wrongdoing; or
o    Shows or tends to show wrongdoing, on an objective test, regardless of what the whistleblower believes;
•    Remedies available to whistleblowers if they are disadvantaged as a result of making a disclosure are clearly set out in legislation, as are the processes through which a whistleblower mightseek such remedy;
•    It is a criminal offence to take or threaten to take a reprisal against a person (such as discriminatory treatment, termination of employment or injury) because they have made or propose to make a disclosure; and
•    In limited circumstances, protections are extended to cover external disclosures to third parties, such as the media.

Forexample currently there is a requirement for Lobbyists to list owners. Many of the Lobbying companies list as owners various anonymous entities, for example, as holding companies, consolidated funds, investment funds or trusts. Without knowing the beneficiaries of these anonymous entities, there is no real transparencyaround potential conflict of interests.

Actionable 1:  To ensure the published list of owners is full and complete naming all the beneficiaries.  Where there are extensive and complex financial networks (and/or where there are shareholders over a certain number), the exact relationship to the lobbying entity and any subsidiaries should be listed.   Smaller family trusts and other business entities should stipulate all beneficiaries.  
Actionable 2:  End the scoping study for the sale of the ASIC Register. Make Register free and easy to access.  This would make it easier to ascertain ownership and beneficiaries of business entities. ASIC entries should include all beneficiaries not only the name of the administering accountant.   This would not only assist in improving transparency around lobbying but also around corporate arrangements in general.
Actionable 3: Institute a ban on former politicians, especially Ministers taking up positions in lobbying organisations, corporations orin associations involved in lobbying activities on behalf of members.  This is particularly relevant where a Minister with former portfolio responsibilities might enter into a business relationship post- politics that directly relates to their former role; and would be perceived as conflict of interest whilst in the performance of parliamentary duties.  In other words remove the ’revolving door’ between government and business interests. A working group might determine a reasonable period of time to elapse, if any, before being able to take up such a role post politics.
Actionable 4:  Design a plan to reform political donations.  The best option would be to ban donations altogether to remove any conflict of interest and interference in the democratic process.   A working group formed to establish a system of taxpayer funded revenue being used for limited campaigning such as for brochures (letterboxing), shared time for candidates on ABC television and radio to outline their policies. The Americanisation of political campaigning that requires large sums of money to travel and spruik does not contribute to the democratic process. Essentially all that voters require is a comprehensive understanding of policies each candidate/party brings to the electorate so that each can make an informed choice without the distraction of spin.  Ideally, get rid of the travelling campaign buses which are distractions from real intentions.  Stick with policy outlines that are easy to understand including funding.  This would also make any taxpayer funded contributions to candidates affordable and relevant.
Actionable 5:  Institute a policy of open access to politicians’ diaries and travel arrangements which could be published online in close to real time (i.e. the day after) as possible.   This would mean travel bookings could no longer be vague, such as SUBURB to SUBURB, or ‘As Directed’ without disclosing purpose of travel and appointment details. This would also aid in stemming the flow of potential travel entitlement fraud.
Actionable 6:  Implement a close to real-time disclosure of political donations published on the Australian Electoral Commission website (if a ban on political donations - as in Actionable 4 - not be considered at this time).

This step would raise the transparency and build trust in government and help counter Australia's slide on international anti-corruption measures. The specific scope of investigation powers should be determined through the involvement of a citizen's panel and be a transparent process such that Australian citizens can have confidence that the mechanism will meet its goals of providing an independent review of potentially corrupt or inappropriate conduct that is currently self-investigated by parliament and agencies.

Given that Australia's Special Minister of State, who is currently responsible for investigating such matters, recently stepped down due to a police investigation into his own conduct, and recent public concern and scrutiny over conduct by other parliamentarians, the creation of this mechanism would go a long way towards restoring confidence in the Australian parliament and support the OGP' anti-corruption goals.",Government Integrity,,

4.18,"Improve transparency around political donations. To improve transparency around political donations, pass legislation that establishes a single independent entity that administers all political donations; managing collection, distribution to the nominated party or individual candidate and public reporting.

Political parties should be legally forbidden from receiving donations from outside this mechanism, and individuals, groups and organisations should be forbidden from offering donations outside this mechanism. The system should be audited annually and be 
paid for by taking a small percentage of donations made (2-3%). The system should have front-end tools for individuals, political parties and organisations to embed donation taking systems into their own sites,so that from a donater's perspective it functions identically to makinga donation directly to a political party or organisation.

This approach would allow real-time reporting of total donations by candidate, party and overall - where they are coming from and build a history of where specific donors have made donations to the same party and candidates.

Unless there is a compelling reason to support anonymous donations, all donations of any amount should be tracked through this system, with randomised verification and checking methods to minimise the ability of donors to conceal the entity making the donation.

In the future it would be possible to extend this system to state and local elections as a central system for managing and reporting all political donations across Australia, reducing the capacity of organisations and wealthy individuals to inappropriately influence MPs or parties and creating true transparency across the entire system. If possible the system should be designed as an open source solution and the code made available for scrutiny.",Government Integrity,,

Transparency International Australia is fully supportive of the leading role played by TI UK in working closely with the UK Prime Minister's office to develop a sound and achievable agenda for the upcoming Anti-Corruption Summit in London in May 2016. Transparency International's priorities for the summit are listed below. We strongly urge the Australian Government, in the spirit of Open Government, to not only make public commitments to the final priorities at the Summit, but to also take a leading role in establishing open data as a core component of those commitments made by world leaders gathered at that time. We also encourage the Australian Government to develop and ongoing follow-up plan out of the UK Summit that forms a part of the OGP National Action Plan on the topic of anti-corruption.

TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES FOR THE LONDON ANTI-CORRUPTION SUMMIT
Corruption has a corrosive impact on prosperity, growth, security, and the fight against extreme poverty. Transparency International believes the London Anti-Corruption Summit provides a unique opportunity for global leaders to signal intent at the highest level for tackling corruption head-on through concrete, ambitious commitments that can be implemented over the next five years. Global leaders must form a united front in the face of corruption and take action so that: 

- Corrupt groups and individuals are not able to act with impunity and get away with their crimes.
- Businesses receive no benefit from taking part in dodgy deals and operating in the darkness.
- The people who are hurt most by corruption receive justice.
The London Anti-Corruption Summit should generate time-bound commitments that will: 
1. Prevent corruption: Make it harder to hide and transfer and benefit from the proceeds of corruption by championing full beneficial ownership information transparency.
2. End Impunity: Improve the way law enforcement agencies in key countries and between banks, business, civil society share and act on intelligence, related to risk and suspicions of corruption.
3. Empower and support citizens to seek justice: Promote accountability and citizen engagement on corruption, and protect activists to do their work.
The Summit should also ensure that the tools and mechanisms are in place to ensure effective implementation and monitoring of the commitments over a 3-5 year period.
Finally, whilst the UK’s leadership in convening the Summit is welcome, it remains crucial that the UK gets its own house in order. This is most evident in the need for the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to adhere to the same standards in the UK with regards to beneficial ownership transparency. They must be required to publish time-bound plans of action for adopting public beneficial ownership registries.

TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL’S SUMMIT VISION
Outlined below are key deliverables that could be adopted by governments at the London Summit in order to prevent corruption, end impunity and empower and support citizens to seek justice.

PREVENT CORRUPTION
1. Champion full transparency of company ownership and control information 
- Governments should set out clear timelines for establishing central, public registries containing beneficial ownership information.
- Governments should support the adoption of a multi-stakeholder-led Global Public Beneficial Ownership Registry to aggregate information from government registries as well as collate that disclosed by proactive companies and via sectoral initiatives such as the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative. This registry could provide a welcome solution for smaller states to save the cost of collecting information from scratch as well as allowing companies to publish the information once, rather than multiple times.

2. End the use of secret companies to bid for public contracts and purchase real estate
- Governments should require that any company bidding for a public contract or purchasing and selling property should disclose its beneficial ownership information. 

3. Prosecute and de-license professional enablers.
- Governments should fully comply with FATF standards to require professionals in law and accountancy, real estate, as well as company formation agents and bankers to have in place anti-money laundering procedures and report suspicions of money laundering. 
- Governments should establish more effective administrative sanctions by encouraging professional bodies to withdraw professional licenses from those implicated in such cases.

END IMPUNITY FOR CORRUPTION
1. Strengthen law enforcement cooperation and information sharing between jurisdictions
- Improve the mechanisms by which intelligence is shared between law enforcement agencies in different jurisdictions. Also seek to develop mechanisms through which banks, business, civil society and other stakeholders can share information related to risk and suspicions of corruption.

2. Close the door to the corrupt individuals 
- Governments should agree to develop commonly agreed “integrity” criteria for investor programmes and require strong due diligence processes prior to issuing residency permits or visas. 
- Governments should commit to develop a transparent visa denial-of-entry regime – which has human rights and due diligence safeguards- that is based on clear criteria for how to address individuals suspected of corruption. Countries should publish specific statistics on visas and entries refused on the basis of corruption.

3. Debarment
- Like-minded governments should establish a common debarment system which adopts and applies administrative sanctions. A list of debarred companies should be made public, similar to the online World Bank Listing of Ineligible Firms & Individuals. Any new system should leverage existing debarment databases.

EMPOWER AND SUPPORT CITIZENS TO REPORT CORRUPTION AND SECURE JUSTICE 
1. Provide safe spaces to report corruption and seek redress
- Governments should issue a London Declaration of support to protect the space and safety of civil society organisations, anti-corruption activists and whistle blowers.
- Governments that still lack whistleblower legislation should pass and implement loophole‐free, stand‐alone whistleblower protection legislation in both the public and private sector.
- Government should support protective measures for activists and whistleblowers, including through increased support to initiatives for reporting, responding to and seeking redress for corruption complaints, and by providing strong digital security and physical protection measures.

2. Improve asset recovery frameworks
- Governments should commit to return stolen assets securely through a process that has openness and accountability at its heart. Where there are legitimate corruption risks in the repatriation process, this process should include looking at alternatives that are effective, open, accountable and participatory. 
- Governments should seek to implement the UN Convention Against Corruption article on illicit enrichment criminal offences, or Unexplained Wealth Order civil offences (depending on the national legal context).

3. Open up government data to help increase citizen engagement and move from promoting transparency to promoting accountability.
- Governments should sign up to and adhere to the Open Contracting Global Principles and associated Data Standard to make better use of government driven data.
- Governments should adopt the International Open Data Charter and make existing datasets progressively available as open data in widely used formats that are nonproprietary, searchable, sortable, platform-independent and machine-readable 
- Governments should adopt effective asset declaration systems to help detect illicit enrichment and reduce conflict of interest. Asset disclosures should include elements that could potentially influence or corrupt public officials: assets, liabilities, income from all sources, gifts and potential conflicts of interest.

TOOLS AND IMPLEMENTATION
Support company transparency and accountability
Governments should establish and champion high standards in anti-corruption and transparency in companies. For example, governments should use procurement conditions to incentivise the disclosure of beneficial ownership information and anti-corruption programmes.

Promote data literacy and engagement on corruption
Governments should promote open data literacy by supporting the collaborative development of guides, documents, training and tools that can increase the effectiveness and use of open data across government, civil society and business sectors.

Develop 3-5 year action plans
To sustain momentum in the aftermath of the Summit, it is crucial that counties develop action plans on implementing their commitments, and/or integrate their commitments into other mechanisms, such as the Open Government Partnership National Action Plans and their delivery of national strategies to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. A commitment to time-bound deliverables and regular collective check-ins should be established.",Government Integrity,,
4.22,"Integrity of Resource Management. Lead Agency: Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
Outline
The more effective management of public resources is increasingly recognised as requiring high standards of integrity by public officers. These ethical standards depend on an integrity system led and practiced from the highest level of the public sector and followed at every level. The integrity system depends on both structure and culture, and the interaction between them, for its effectiveness. 
Effective integrity systems have been shown to expose unethical, improper and illegal activities that were otherwise undetected despite their damaging impacts on the efficient and effective use of public resources (e.g. reports by NSW ICAC, Qld CCC, Vic IBAC). Effective integrity systems reduce the risk of ineffective management of public resources.
The integrity system must operate across all arms of the system of government and recognise that Members of Parliament are public officers who, as such, must put the public interest ahead of all personal and other private interests. Unethical, improper or corrupt behaviour is incompatible with their entrusted responsibilities and undermines and detracts from their performance of the parliament and hence the effective management of public resources.
Australia recognised this when it pledged to support the Harare Commonwealth Declaration 1991. The Declaration provided (amongst other things) for Commonwealth countries:
“to work with renewed vigour, concentrating especially in the following areas:
• the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values of the Commonwealth;
• democracy, democratic processes and institutions which reflect national circumstances, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, just and honest government.”
That pledge clearly indicates that the democratic system, of which Parliament is the peak institution, should function according to the rule of law, justice and honesty.
More recently, international standards for parliaments were established by the Recommended Benchmarks for Legislatures, adopted in 2006 by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the UNDP and the World Bank. The recommendations include:
10. Ethical Governance
10.1 Transparency and Integrity
10.1.1 Legislators should maintain high standards of accountability, transparency and responsibility in the conduct of all public and parliamentary matters.
10.1.2 The Legislature shall approve and enforce a code of conduct, including rules on conflicts of interest and the acceptance of gifts.
10.1.3 Legislatures shall require legislators to fully and publicly disclose their financial assets and business interests.
10.1.4 There shall be mechanisms to prevent, detect, and bring to justice legislators and staff engaged in corrupt practices.
Each House of Parliament should adopt its code of conduct independently, as each is autonomous from the other House. Neither House of the Parliament of Australia has adopted a code of conduct. Comparable parliaments, such as the UK House of Commons at Westminster and the Canadian House of Commons, have well-established and highly developed integrity systems including codes applying to their Houses and Members of Parliament.
However, codes of conduct and like instruments (e.g. code of ethics; conflict of interest code) do vary widely in their provisions and effectiveness. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association commissioned Recommended Benchmarks for Codes of Conduct Applying to Members of Parliament, published in 2015. These recommendations specify the principles that should be incorporated in a code of conduct and complementary provisions, having regard to local circumstances e.g. the size and resources of the parliament.
Recommendation: That
• The Government propose and lead the development and adoption of a Parliamentary Integrity System, including a code of conduct for each of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
• Each code of conduct be based on the Recommended Benchmarks for Codes of Conduct Applying to Members of Parliament.
• In developing each code, regard be had to the equivalent parliamentary integrity system, including codes, of the UK House of Commons and the Canadian House of Commons and the National Integrity System in which each is embedded. 
• The Government support a culture of integrity in each House of Parliament to enable the effectiveness of its code of conduct.

4.23,"The Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV), the umbrella body for Victoria’s 79 local Councils, is proposing that the Federal Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development could deliver more focussed and responsive regional development programs and services by increasing transparency and public participation. This would occur by establishing an online register of Community Plans on a regional basis across Australia. In Victoria there are now in excess of 700 Community Plans, which are documents produced as a result of community-driven processes to identify community priorities in rank order (with number 1 being the most important). These community plans are owned and developed by the community, with the local Council playing a supporting role. In most cases community members have voted to determine the highest priority projects. Community Plans are produced in every State and Territory across Australia but in most cases they are not utilised in the development of regional plans by State and Federal Governments, who produce regional development plans and strategies that are often not addressing the priority needs of local communities.

By way of example, the Golden Plains Shire Council has about 20 Community Plans documented on their web site at https://www.goldenplains.vic.gov.au/page.aspx?u=345
Golden Plains Council has a population of some 18,000 people and some 4,000 are involved in the community planning process. It was only via the community planning process that the Council identified, by examining the common priorities across a large number of community plans, that there were very significant deficiencies in post- hospital specialist health care in the area. This has triggered a revolution in health services in the region in the last 5-10 years, supported by State and Federal Governments.

Proposed by Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) via John Hennessy
The suggested Community Plan register would group and summarise community plans by region and would be updated whenever the community plans are updated (usually every 1-3 years). This information is currently not aggregated except by individual Councils, and so is usually not utilised by State and Federal Governments in developing policies or strategies for regional development. The ability to be able to identify local and regional community priorities from a single source has the potential to transform regional service delivery so it is more responsive to local priorities rather than adopting the usual cookie cutter’ approach of programs being developed by bureaucrats on a ‘one glove fits all’ basis. Policy and program developers would be able to rapidly assess where the gaps are in service delivery: for example, are roads or health or learning or broadband solutions most needed by local communities? If the Federal (and State) Government is to become more agile, efficient and effective, it needs to ensure its resources (programs and services) are more focussed on addressing priority local community needs. In the past decade there has been a massive amount of waste and duplication with Federal and State Governments producing a range of regional development plans, most of which have sat on the shelf with very little, if any, action. The National Online Community Plan Register would be the first step to more community-driven public services.

Who can support this process? Local Government Associations around Australia can assist to promote and develop this register.",Government Integrity,,
4.23.1,"In Western Australia there is legislative requirements for all local governments (approx 140) to have Strategic Community Plans in place (reviewed every 4 years) These Plans are developed through a process of community and stakeholder engagement and outline community aspirations/priorities for each local government area. The Corporate/Business Plans for each local government then outline how they will respond and contribute to these community priorities and may include the role played - e.g. Provider, Partner, Funder, Regulator, Monitor, Facilitator, Advocate. Local governments have a wealth of information about their local communities, if there was a process to aggregate all this local knowledge up into one location/data set it would provide a great learning opportunity for Federal government initiatives - so rather than go out to engage again with the community - it may be that the the knowledge already exists - gathered through existing engagement processes. The challenge is how to collate this information.",Government Integrity,,

Need: Keeping and building on ‘corporate memory’
Activity to meet this need
Formal requirement for government staff, five years from retirement, to mentor younger employees for 12 months. Agreement of the organisation, retiring employee and the younger employee that ‘shadowing’ is an important work task of both employees and a formal part of their professional development. The basic process is below and this is expected to evolve through individual and organisation involvement and need.
1. 'Shadow' a senior government employee (who has more than 15 years of government work experience) with the senior employee purposefully showing and explaining their most valuable work tools and likely barriers;
2. Attend structured meetings to learn from the senior employees long-term lived experience of developing positive work relationships, dealing with intricate organisational knowledge, managing transitions and agile change. 

How it works
The mentoring program has rules and requirements similar to staff training but the content is the lived experience of the senior staff member's work history. Particularly the technological, social, political, work/home balance and economic capital useful in enabling more efficient organisation policies, plans and processes. This activity also refines career path planning and professional development decisions. I strongly suggest that more places for females and minority groups be allocated to this program to increase government staff diversity.
The benefit to the senior mentor includes reflecting upon new insights, perspectives, information offered by the younger person. Noting when their work and life experiences are of benefit and can improve current and planned projects. Also, as the senior employee retires, the organisation may decide to contract the retired person to ‘soft mentor’ senior executives.
Monitor and evaluate
Such employee interaction needs to be a work duty with details of how selection of mentor/mentee occurs, how work is planned with privacy/confidentiality clauses, the means to review progress and ways to stop the interaction when required. Reporting on the process is required at 3 month intervals. A common report is prepared as well as individual reports. Work completed during these interactions will carry both people's names for transparent recognition and appraisal. An employee who has observed the interactions is also required to evaluate the benefits, challenges and problems at 6 and 12 months.

The Statements of Approach would set out how that candidate proposes to represent the electorate - both in terms of regular communication and the extent to which they commit to using participatory and deliberative processes for decision making. 
The Statements of Approach would be formatted in a common format (decided by the Electoral Commission using a sound public consultation method), to improve comparability, and available on-line as well as in public libraries, Council offices etc.The purpose of the standard template would be to improve voters ability to compare candidates.

5.2,"This is welcome news, and appreciate the thought that has gone into design of consultative steps so far.

Two comments.

One, you state
“At this stage, it is envisioned that the first Australian Government’s NAP will focus on the two OGP grand challenges of:
• Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of citizen services including health, education, criminal justice, water, electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation; and
• More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign assistance.”

Many outside government might ponder the ‘envisioning’ without outside input that led to this choice of these two challenges from the five laid out by the OGP, leaving this challenge off the agenda:
“. Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom.”

Two, experience elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance the partnership concept and add value. There is no mention of such a body in the published material. NZ, well into the process is just one of many countries that have now gone down this path.

5.3,"m writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).

The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.

The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of priorities for consideration.

Current Steering Committee members are:

Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash University)
Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the process of doing so.

At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.

The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.

The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the government moves ahead on this important initiative.

Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.

While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members of the public.

While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be substantial national engagement activity.

The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his Cabinet Ministers.

While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation website.

As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to public attention.

Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP membership process in mainstream media.

The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national campaign of engagement.

Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials published online. However these materials are not readily available to interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.

In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a challenge even for those aware of the process.

While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely taking place.

It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.

General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include Public Integrity.

Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.

The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and timeline.

The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.

The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states, territories and local government must be part of the open government journey. The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.

The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.

The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent government.”

As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan, wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”

Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background material.

At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti corruption matters.

The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.

Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan required by the convention.

The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.

The Plan states:

“G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our government agencies, policies, and officials implement international best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement, open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public officials as issues which merit particular attention.”

The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:

“16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption. Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset disclosure frameworks…”

The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles.

Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the consultation proceeds.

5.4,"I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.
However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by this approach to ‘engagement’",Engagement for OGP,,

5.5,"Just a couple of comments, now that we’re getting to the point of doing things globally.

You’d appreciate that there’s a parallel org to the ogp – the civil society end of gov – so we’ll be able to give you some comparative feedback on how you go about building the Action plan.au. http://www.ogphub.org/napreview-pilot/

Obviously one of the major products of these plans will developing is a “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (built around a citizen’s ID). So we can expect (with your imagination) that ad hoc/buckshot approaches like the gov 2.0 taskforce will start firming up into a platform which may be used by gov, and civil society, groups around the world. http://open4m.org/about-us/

You’re very lucky to have many existing groups of correspondents in various countries already that span between the internal groups of a government and the civil society groups with which they coordinate “actions”. e.g. http://forum.opengovernment.org.uk/groups/ogp

One more note as you say “NZ and other governments have generally established their groups after getting the national action plan developed”. That’s not what they are telling others. “New Zealand (as one) is in the process of setting up a Stakeholder Advisory Group to assist with developing, implementing and evaluating their plans”. http://www.ogphub.org/blog/advancing-ogp-in-asia-pacific/

Personally I prefer the way you’re going about it – keeping things open. As Shreya (your OGP contact in Singapore) says in the doc above, “The important thing now is to sustain the positive momentum generated by OGP and create permanent dialogue mechanisms, with clear terms of reference, representation drawn from groups that go beyond the ‘usual suspects’ and regular meetings to strengthen the impact of the OGP process on government-civil society engagement and to mitigate against risks posed by changes in leadership.”

5.8,"TIA congratulates the Australian Government and Prime Minister Turnbull for the recent decision to commit to finalizing Australia’s membership of the OGP, and for the proactive approach it is taking to public consultation in the development of the first Australian Government National Action Plan.

The OGP requires broad consultation in the development of the NAP – from the public, civil society and the private sector. TIA’s comments come from its perspective as the leading civil society organization promoting transparency, integrity and accountability, and fighting corruption.

Introduction

Now that it has decided to commit to finalizing its membership of the OGP, the government is moving with commendable speed to draft its first National Action Plan by May 2016, for government consideration in June 2016, and a launch in July 2016. This speed does bring risks – that the first National Action Plan is essentially a ‘goodwill’ document, not ambitious enough and not containing commitments of substance. The second risk is that to meet these tight timelines the consultation process will be structured in a way which downplays the opportunity for real input from civil society and other non-government sectors. The Government and its advisers may take the view that it is better to have a first NAP, however imperfect, and that the NAP process and content will be much more satisfactory the second time around. TIA’s job, and that of civil society generally, is to participate as fully as possible in the development of a first NAP which is ambitious in scope and commitment, and flags priority areas for future NAPs. TIA is committed to membership of the Australian Open Government Partnership Network recently constituted

The remainder of this short paper flags some initial comments and areas of interest to TIA.

Increasing Public Integrity

The OGP – Australia website has already indicated that the first National Action Plan will focus on two of the OGP’s five ‘grand challenges’: Improving Public Services, and More Effectively Managing Public Resources. This decision was made without public consultation on whether other ‘grand challenges’ should have greater priority, especially Increasing Public Integrity (‘measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom’). Successive Australian Governments have made considerable and sustained progress in improving public services and more effectively managing public resources, whereas limited and patchy progress has been made in the areas of corruption and public ethics, access to information, and campaign finance reform. In other words, there is much more to do in relation to increasing public integrity. TIA recommends that the Government include Increasing Public Integrity as one of its initial ‘grand challenges’.

Identification of specific measures in the Australian NAP

Many of the potential transparency gains from the OGP are cross-cutting issues that affect integrity in other sectors, other nations and multiple levels of government. In several countries, including the UK, ‘open government’ has been used to identify and implement crucial transparency and accountability measures such as the establishment of registers of beneficial ownership of companies, lifting the veil on opaque shell companies that the corrupt use to hold and transfer their illicit gains, implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative or developing comprehensive national anti-corruption agencies or comprehensive national anti-corruption action plans.

TIA recommends that the Australian Government demonstrate its full commitment to participation in the Open Government Partnership, by undertaking to use open government reforms to meet the challenge of increasing public integrity in its national action plan, as an important element in increasing transparency and lowering corruption in Australia – and in particular by implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, ensuring greater transparency in public procurement, and committing to a public register of corporate beneficial owners.

Right to Information

In 2014 the Federal Government withdrew funding and introduced legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and to reassign its functions to other government agencies and departments. The legislation has failed to pass the Parliament, and is unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future, leaving the OAIC ‘in limbo’ and the national FOI, privacy and information policy regimes in jeopardy. Abolition of the OAIC and dispersal of its strategic and operational functions between existing agencies and departments risks fragmentation of access to information rights and tools, which have historically been crucial in preventing and exposing corruption.
TIA recommends that as part of its development of the draft National Action Plan the Australian Government should renew its full support for a strong access to information regime by withdrawing legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, re-instating funding for the OAIC to fulfill its mandate in relation to freedom of information, privacy, and information policy, and ensuring the prompt appointment of a new Australian Information Commissioner with full powers, located in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Multi-stakeholder oversight group

Experience in developing OGP National Action Plans elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance and add value to the partnership. The role of civil society in Australia’s OGP is critical, not just to ensure Australia’s OGP membership, but because the initiative is chaired equally between government and civil society in each country.

The proposed consultation process for the development of Australia’s first NAP is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not provide for effective joint civil society and government input into, and oversight of, the development of the first NAP. Providing opportunities for feedback and comment is not a substitute for participation in finalising a draft NAP for government consideration. TIA therefore recommends that at least one civil society representative is invited to join the group of officials charged with finalising the draft NAP for government consideration.

In the longer term, TIA recommends the establishment of a multi-stakeholder oversight group, comprising government, civil society, the private sector and the communications sector, to ensure ongoing commitment to fulfilling OGP obligations.

TIA affirms the need to involve a range of departments and agencies across Government. An example of where such interdepartmental engagement would be beneficial would be necessary and beneficial is ensuring a link between the OPG process and the fulfillment of Australia’s commitment to develop a plan to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. That process should also be multi-stakeholder involving government civil society and the private sector.",Engagement for OGP,,
5.9,"Vision
There is not much in the way of a vision in the published material.

Perhaps we couldn’t do much better than draw on the Open Government Declaration thus:

“The Australian Government with input from its citizens is committed to improved democratic practices in line with the OGP Open Government Declaration:
•“to promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the power of new technologies to make government more effective and accountable.”
•“to uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer communities”
•“to embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own countries and in an increasingly interconnected world.”

Grand Challenges
It is disappointing that the published material in parts suggests important decisions about ‘grand challenges’ that may limit commitments the government is prepared to consider have been made without any consultation.

For example these statements:
“through consultation, the aim is for the first Australian Government’s National Action Plan to include ambitious actions that support the OGP grand challenges of improving public services and better managing public resources… Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of what will improve public services and improve management of public resources, as well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities for business and support innovation in Australia.”

However another sentence brings transparency and accountability and public engagement into the picture:
“Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public service delivery, increase the transparency and accountability of government, and encourage greater public engagement. It also an opportunity for the public, civil society, and the private sector to contribute ideas for how government can achieve those goals.”

Unilateral decisions about the scope of what will be considered would be an unfortunate start to a “partnership.”

Consultation should commence and proceed on the basis of OGP guidance that the plan in its final form should “consist of a set of commitments that advance transparency, accountability, participation and/or technological innovation.”
http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/develop-a-national-action-plan

Within that broad framework nothing should be ruled out before consultation starts.
As the process moves toward finality there should be no difficulty in grouping agreed commitments in a way that addresses one or more of the ‘challenges’, the only OGP requirement.

Framework
According to the published material:
“The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&C will work with other agencies across the Australian Public Service and other jurisdictions within Australia to develop the NAP….”

Given the wide range of issues likely to arise, consideration should be given to establishing formal inter-departmental, inter-governmental and government-civil society mechanisms to play a part at various stages during the development of proposals, the determination of priorities and action taken to implement commitments.

OGP related issues should not be considered in isolation.

For example during the period ahead the government will develop plans to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.
http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/

An OGP initiative encourages member countries to link both by signing the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2013 Agenda for Sustainable Development
http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_declaration.pdf

Goal 16 and a number of the related targets are particularly relevant in the context of the development of Australia’s national action plan.
Goal16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”

SDG targets for this goal include:
Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all;
Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms;
Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels;
Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels;
Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance;
Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.

Australia should sign the Declaration.

The Government should establish a formal mechanism that ensures co-ordinated consideration of OGP, SDG and related strategic policy challenges. A high level inter agency group would assist this process.

If ‘other jurisdictions’ are to be part of the framework (the OGP is talking of sub-national and city engagement) that too may require a formal mechanism to bring state, territory, city and local government along.

And a joint government stakeholder group or forum to guide the partnership process and final decisions on the plan would give proper recognition to the fact that OGP decisions require joint ownership befitting a partnership.",Engagement for OGP,,

5.14,"1. Establish a team with a mandate to broadly improve both public sector and broader public understanding of open government and related issues.

Justification, public sector:: There is a significant knowledge and understanding gap when it comes to communicating with agencies and local governments, and we need to see communication being one of the major focal points for any reform effort. At the moment, there are a bundle of things we're trying to break through, from the inevitable 'but this will just mean more work and cost us money' or 'but this is OUR agency's special project', to some agencies not having a good basic understanding of either the technological aspects or what we're even trying to achieve. 

Justification, broader public: There needs to be more attention given to communicating with the broader public about what we're trying to achieve, how it's going, what's been delivered, and really showcasing work that has a broad public interest (frequently maps / social sciences / citizen science) in the context of open knowledge. Things that aren't necessarily economically material, but are important because they raise levels of public expectation and awareness, ensuring that engaging citizens with data remains a priority for future governments.

2. Establish a local government (and potentially small-agency) support program to give hands-on assistance in scoping and delivering meaningful projects.

Justification: small agencies and certainly local governments will need more than funding to deliver change – there’s a big need for mentoring and practical assistance. This obviously going to be much harder than just providing funding, but these are very small organisations and won't get past the stage of developing ideas and scoping a project without both the enthusiasm and support of others working in the space.

The government use this to include them in relevant policy and budgeting discussions. The Government could then create an ongoing dialogue mechanism with these organisations. This could include a system that automatically invites them to participate in policy and budgeting reviews that effect their areas of expertise and experience. There should also be a budget associated with facilitating participation for the organisations, given that there are many small and resource-limited.

These sensitivities can not be overlooked.

There is also conversations about who owns the data collected. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander orgs are required to report their data and there is ongoing tensions about who owns that data.

Questions were asked about engagement with and from the private sector and the need to develop messaging for that audience / potential data users was discussed. The limits of the Grand Challenges was raised. Whether themes were helpful was also openly discussed. The group was also informed by one participant that an independent researcher had been appointed in 2014 to review Australia's implementation of the initial OGP commitment. The question about the continuity of the NAP if Government of Australia changed was also raised. There was also a question about whether / how commitments that could not be delivered over two years would be dealt with - now as the first NAP is developed, and in the development of the next NAP. The importance of cultural change and the role of time in raising awareness / encouraging engagement was discussed. I suggested the group contact the OGP team with some of these questions. 
The rest of the call focused on five topics: 1) Engaging to deliver commitments and actions - with civil society and the States; 2) Engaging to report NAP progress, and encourage greater engagement in Open Government across Australia; 3) Engagement for development of the next NAP; 4) Independent NAP review process. When discussing 1) the group felt multi-stakeholder working groups would be required to help deliver OGP NAP commitments. Across the states and in some cases with civil society. The discussion around point 2) included the importance of storytelling, the need for a communication plan and forum / mechanisms that enable the reporting of both NAP progress, and encourage stories from those sharing from those releasing data, using data, increasing public participation and opening government across Australia.

As they push their way into the lives of ordinary citizens, invading farm lands, spoiling the environment and depriving indigenous communities of their humble means of survival (particularly in many poorer countries), they are judged as being powerful, undemocratic and representative of the rich and greedy. This is a strongly growing trend. While the executives of such companies are legally required to maximise the financial benefits of their shareholders rather than required to act in a way that is in the best interests of the public generally, there is a social divide that is likely to grow.

2. Set targets and measure results for open publishing and use of creative commons licenses
3. Develop a government open access policy similar to the ARC and NHMRC
An open access policy should be adopted for all government funded research published in academic journals. These could be similar to that of the ARC and the NHMRC and should also encourage use of open access journals where available.

7.6.3,"
This suggestion closely aligns with concept of a ""Gov API"" or ""Mashable Government"". Pia Waugh describes the end goal: https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/making-government-discoverable/
To achieve ""Gov API"" in a long term sustainable manner is non-trivial, but can be broken down into many small steps. Key concepts which need to be considered are:
Open Standards facilitate wide scale and long term interoperability. However there is tension between ""quick fixes"", or ""vendor lock-in APIs"" versus open standards adoption.
Adopting existing international standards is often an option and should be encouraged where available. Contributing to development of international standards is time consuming, and involves long term commitments to do well.
It is important to enable whole-of-government strategies while also facilitating rapid innovation.
Maintenance strategies: IT assets, such as government data, rapidly become dated and need refreshing and/or archiving. As such whole-of-life maintenance strategies should be considered.
Business Cases: (This is worthy of a suggestion by itself). Government agencies should be provided with strategies and guidelines to write business cases to predict the success versus cost of different Gov API strategies. Typically government officials have mandate to solve department-wide problems, however solutions will often be best justified at a Whole-Of-Government, or Whole-Of-World level.

7.7,"Problem/issue to be addressed
Publications and other resources produced or commissioned by government departments and agencies are notoriously difficult to find and access for a number of reasons including having publication withheld, or disappearing from online access due to poor management practices and lack of a public repository for government material.

Improve the discovery and accessibility of government publications, data and other resources to maximise long term public access and use of government research and information by investing in publishing infrastructure, principles and practices.

Strategy: Establish an open publications repository for government documents
Establish a public, open access, online, whole-of-government publication and resource repository for publishing and ongoing access and management of government publications.This could utilise and extend an existing external repository to integrate with other policy resources (using APO for example apo.org.au), use a government-run system (data.gov.au) or be a new product developed for this purpose.

7.8,"This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in government through its legislated role of setting records and information management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and preserving and providing a public right of access to government information.

Open government increases the transparency and accountability of government, encourages greater public engagement, strengthens governance and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key role in open government by promoting the creation, management and preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information, and facilitating access to this information.

The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and effectively covers all information created, used or received in the course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) (Archives Act), the National Archives:
•	identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
•	preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth accessible;
•	oversees Commonwealth records management;
•	determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
•	imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.

Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government policy. It is from this perspective and with this legislated role that the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on the Vision and the framework for the National Action Plan.

Vision
The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved management of, and accessibility to, information and records. A key element of this is a move to fully digital information management and business processes across the Australian government sector. This aligns with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading including earlier access to government records, the Digital Continuity 2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.

The National Archives also recommends that the Vision and Plan recognise Australia’s strong open government history, culture, initiatives and policies already in existence, including the Archives Act, to demonstrate Australia as a leading example of open government well before the Open Government Partnership came into being.

The government also recognises through legislation such as the Archives Act 1983, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 the need to restrict the circulation of some information for a particular time in order to protect the defence and security of the nation, its relationship with the world, and the privacy of citizens. The Archives Act entrusts the National Archives with this role in relation to government information and provides for the exemption from public release of a number of categories of information including national security, defence, international relations, confidential information, and personal affairs. When sensitivities lapse, information that was formerly withheld can be made available for access. The balance between the need to protect information from unauthorised use or accidental release, and open government principles should be considered in development of the Vision.

The Australian Government’s policy of open government is well established, and it is therefore well positioned to contribute to the Open Government Partnership and the National Action Plan. It will also be well positioned to target areas that require more effort to continue to advance open government in Australia. The National Archives has, and will continue to, play a key role in supporting open government initiatives by carrying out its core functions and by effectively contributing to Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership.

Framework
The National Archives supports the general framework outlined in the Australian Government National Action Plan template, and recommends a clear and strong statement of Open Government achievements to date from both a contemporary and historical context. We would particularly like to note Australia as one of the most open archival and government information access regimes in the world through the management, preservation and provision of access to government information under the Archives Act.

Established by the Act, one of the National Archives’ key roles is enabling public access to the archival resources of the nation. Through this role, the Archives has played a lead in open government and ensuring that citizens have access to the decisions and actions of their government, thereby supporting the rights and entitlements of individuals and promoting accountability and transparency.",Open Data,,

This list should be created in collaboration with the public and provide a standard to facilitate maximising the value that can be created through open data.",Open Data,,

Citizens deserve to be able to make up their own minds based on factual information, not through the lens of the 'spin' of either government or opposition, and to question decisions which do not appear to be supported by the facts or independent recommendations - or at least require the government to be more accountable to the public for the decisions it makes.",Open Data,,

7.14,"In August 2015 the NZ Government agreed to establish a Data Futures Partnership, a cross-sector group of influential people working together to drive high-trust and high-value data use for all New Zealanders. Australia could take a similar approach, and in particular use and adapt the 'catalyst project' seed funding model NZ is developing to foster more data driven innovation, more open data release, and more effective trusted data sharing.

Background:
The NZ Data Futures Forum consultation process found there are likely to be huge economic, social and environmental opportunities from treating data as a national strategic asset. It also found that driving social and economic value from data requires a collective effort across the public, private and NGO sectors.

It noted that:
1. The data-use ecosystem is hard to navigate - Data practices and relationships are complex and emerging, and the existing institutions and frameworks are not designed for the emerging environment. There is no clear, authoritative guidance for Ministers and policy makers, or for the people and organisations sharing and using data.
2. Potential for much greater data sharing - Public and private sector organisations have rich data but are unwilling or feel unable to share – because acceptable boundaries for sharing and reuse may be unclear.
3. Tenuous trust - Public trust in the data-use ecosystem is tenuous and, once lost, trust can be hard to restore. Maintaining trust is vital to ongoing data innovation, including Government’s reuse of data to drive investment decisions and target services. There is no independent trusted forum for an inclusive conversation on data use.
4. Potential for more data reuse and innovation to create economic and social value - People and organisations are not using data as much as they could to create value – because of lack of understanding of the value, lack of access to data, fears of negative reactions, or practical barriers such as no data standards or lack of analytics capability.

The Data Futures Partnership is focusing on three streams of work:
- Catalyst Projects to demonstrate the value of data use, and help create ethical and practical frameworks. 
- Diagnose and fix ongoing and emerging issues in the data-use ecosystem. 
- Facilitate a conversation with New Zealanders about the potential value of data use, and to understand their feelings and perspectives on data use.",Open Data,,
7.15,"TOPICS
Open Data. A linked data system would:
- Present the complete picture without administrative boundaries on topics that interest citizens and governments
- Connect the data silos by creating standardised APIs across agencies
- Create a standard workflow for releasing, updating, and using open data by processing all datasets in the same manner through an automated and repeatable process
- Generate five-star open data for all datasets.

PRINCIPLES
- Transparency. An improved workflow for releasing data through an automated linked data workflow will contribute to greater transparency.
- Technology and Innovation. Linked data introduces an innovative system and approach to managing transparency as well as managing public contributions to open data, fostering increased usage for all.

What successful implementation of the idea would look like
A linked data portal will achieve the following:
- Relevant and easy access to government data by citizens
- Specific and focussed search, as well as discoverability of data
- Easy publishing and automatic extraction of topics from data, decreasing the amount of processing
- Workflows for any data contribution.

Government
1. Lisa wants to release her agency's education data, currently stored in proprietary formats, so that it can be used for a consultant to develop an app
2. She uploads the data into the linked data portal
3. The portal automatically extracts entities in the data (eg: 'University of Sydney', 'CSIRO', 'National Portrait Gallery') and locations (eg: 'Brisbane', 'Carlton VIC')
4. The portal then creates an API (Application Programming Interface) for the consultant to develop the app
5. Lisa can re-upload the data at any time to update.

Citizens
1. Mustafa is researching primary schools for his family around his suburb of Carlton, Victoria
2. He types in ""primary schools in Carlton"" in a search engine, taking him to a page on the linked data portal
3. The portal clarifies if he means Carlton, VIC or Carlton, NSW; to which he selects the former
4. A page lists all the schools in Carlton, Victoria, including primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions (which brings up the data that Lisa uploaded above)
5. He clicks on Carlton Gardens Primary School and finds a page containing all the consolidated linked data for that school from various data sources, not just one. There's maps, charts, data about school performance, weather data (as the school has a weather station installed), grants the school has been given, and Victorian Government funding that has been given to the school
6. Mustafa happens to have set up a weather station at home for the kids, and finds that he is able to upload his data to contribute to the weather station set.

Mechanisms to monitor and track progress
- Number of datasets uploaded, entities stored, relationships stored
- Use of individual datasets, but more importantly: use of entities and relationships
- Data turnover rates (if it is updated often, it is successful)
- Website views and analytics
- Use of data across other services and products.

What organisations would be best placed to implement the idea
This is potentially a whole-of-government idea that requires multiple organisations.

Some departments advertise with the clear intent to hire, some advertise just to meet the legal requirements. Frequently, some departments or business units carry out hiring and promotions internally because of a culture of everyone ""fit in"". In such instances, there are no new ideas coming in, there is no one to question internal decisions (because all employees are made of the same mold). This culture perpetuates itself. This results in a lack of Innovation in policy making, lack of innovation in other fields including procurement and infrastructure development (including ICT, communication or implementing OGP ideals). There is no dissent- because there are no dissenters.

Actions Item:
Each subunit of each government department should be required to disclose on its own website and its hiring advertisements as to the absolute number of new hires from outside the group in the past one year, and the number hired internally- including contractors already working there. Such data should be provided/published in a form that can be scrapped by open-data bots and consolidated for access by the public.

7.21.1,"I agree that this is a grave and timely issue. Let me introduce commitment 20 from the current French NAP, which is very related:

DIVERSIFY RECRUITMENT WITHIN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
LEAD INSTITUTIONS: Ministry for Decentralization and the Civil Service
STAKES
The civil service has a duty to be exemplary by reflecting the French society it serves, with its diversity and its evolutions.
CONTEXT & AIM
The State undertakes to facilitate the recruitment of diversified profiles that not only reflect French society, but also that are necessary to support the administrations through digital and open government evolutions.
ROADMAP
 Develop new access channels to the civil service, to improve its opening to society
- In the Bill on ethics and the rights and obligations of civil servants, insert measures to renew access channels to civil service and open them a larger diversity of profiles
- Renew the preparatory classes mechanism for access to competitive examinations of category A in the three branches of the civil service, particularly by increasing by 25% the number of places offered in the integrated preparatory classes preparing candidates for the competitive examinations for entry to the civil service from 2015. The objective for 2016 is to double the number of students, to reach 1,000 places
- Develop apprenticeship in the civil service by multiplying by 10 the number of apprentices, to reach an objective of 4,000 by the beginning of the 2016 school year and 10,000 for 2017
 Address discriminatory biases upon entry into the civil service
- Upon request from the Prime Minister, launch an expert appraisal mission on discrimination issues
- Modify the texts on juries and selection committee’s composition for each ministry to open them to at least one member outside the recruiting administration
- Generalize training courses on discrimination prevention for all future members of juries and selection committees
- Generalize the procedures for the quality certification of human resources departments in order to evaluate all their procedures with regard to any discriminatory risks. Ashok, your proposed action is very simple and costs almost nothing to the departments, but arguably the first step towards addressing this problem. Hopefully, it becomes part of a commitment.

I propose this cross jurisdictional committee be used to create a structure or process (separate to their private meetings) whereby the public can engage with the states to begin to harmonise the open data-sets that are produced by each state and territory so that data-sets on similar topics in each jurisdiction (eg traffic, crime) can be published in a consistent manner with regard to the fields they contain, the frequency with which they are updated and other characteristics that affect their re-use as open data.",Open Data,,

In government departments, when new positions or groups are created, the business unit would be required to inform all employees in that group (and all its cohorts and parent groups up to the first SES level) about the rationale for creating the position or group, source of funding, and goals for the new group or position. This will prevent new groups or positions being created without being much thought over long term needs, and also prevent groups just because funding is available or it fancies a particular person. This would, at least in a small way, insulate interference from elected leaders or lobby groups. 
Policies and decisions made by such newly created groups can potentially become an impediment for other groups, they can become ill-managed and wasteful. Instead of a lean and efficient government, we could be left paying the salaries of a group for decades, this group being a hindrance, rather than help, to better governance.

Participants felt that the Federal Government should play a coordinating role and that cross-jurisdictions structures should be established and managed by Federal Government to coordinate this. There was mention of an Open Data Steering Committee and COAG. The group felt that engagement between those responsible for the release of data was as important as well as executive commitment, and the importance of cross-jurisdictional engagement from staff in similar agencies across was emphasised. A communication strategy and 'How to guide' was also suggested by participants as other ways this coordinating body might to make these processes, and data release across Australia more transparent, increase awareness of it's value and promote use.

Its great and important to make more data available but other resources such as government reports and discussion papers, submissions, FOI type material, archival material etc are very badly managed and are highly likely to be overlooked if the theme is Open Data. Why wouldn't FOI be part of this theme? Is it because information is not considered data? It doesn't make sense to separate them. Moving away from a data only focus would also help to engage many people who aren't necessarily interested in data but do want better access and management of other types of Public sector information such as government publications and records of many kinds, both public and restricted.

If you did this then you can see we have a few main suggestions. If you look at the list below its basically:
1. discovery, access and management of data, including publication of specific, high value datasets
2. discover, access and management of government publications
3. Establish and enforce metadata standards for publishing data and publications 
4. collation of data on government activities such as research projects, donations etc

This would also help address reuse as there is far more economic and social value (and hence incentive) in developing a service that is national than a service that is functional and accurate for only one LGA, or necessitates a great deal of data matching and cleaning at significant expense for 500+ datasets with slightly different collection and publishing standards.

This should include a central register of all government public consultations, including mechanisms for people and organisations to register for alerts for consultations touching on their areas of interest. This approach would help normalise the consultation process for citizens, who would be able to easily discover consultations on topics of interest to them from different agencies through a central location, would be able to respond to consultations in a more standardised and user-friendly way, and would provide support for a broader range of consultation approaches for smaller agencies that otherwise cannot afford to employ techniques which may be more effective than those they currently use.

Interoperability with proprietary tools would also be possible. This would allow innovative engagement and collaboration projects to get off the ground more quickly for less money, with more connectivity between projects.

This approach solves three critical challenges in the use of online for citizen engagement:

1. Duplication: Government spends too much time procuring and setting up online engagements, and not enough time making them succeed
2. Dissipation: Government is forced to rebuild their audience for each new consultation, rather than maintaining a base ready-to-engage citizens who can be proactively invited
3. Fragmentation: Insights from each consultation are stored separately in different data formats, preventing the government from discovering trends and insights from across all consultations

To support this outcome, we propose foregrounding the principles of open innovation and genuine collaboration, to allow the Government to continuously improve the platform by:

- Partnering with other governments, both domestically and globally, to add value to the system

Further, we recommend a “community source” solution that uses open source software best practice, supported by strong collaborative governance to decide the content of the codebase and the software roadmap. We also recommend use of standard software frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Django (Python), as well as open data standards, to ensure that all components of the system are developed in a way that is accessible to a range of providers and participants across the nation. Benefits of this approach include:

- Avoiding license fees and pay-per-user models that make the system prohibitively expensive as soon as you are successful (ie at large, national scales)
- Future-proofing the system to enable integration of other open source and proprietary engagement solutions

Note: This action could be supported by or integrated with the following actions:

- Open policy making
- Provide a way for citizens to easily engage electronically with government agencies.
- Management of data collected through engagement - 'invited data'
- Always-on community listening
- Participatory budgeting to allocate grant funding
- Develop whole of government consultation capabilities that focus on evidence-based policy development
- Introduce citizen-drafted legislation
- Implement a whole-of-government problem solving platform
- Establish a public engagement and collaborative approach to the development, implementation and monitoring of all major public policies.

8.10,"People's Food Policy Process for Australia: Since the food system is foundational to all life, and existing and future wellbeing and sustainability, it is imperative that the voices of as many Australians as possible should be heard in developing a coherent, long-term, fair and sustainable food policy for Australia. 

This links very clearly to the pillar of citizen participation, leading in turn to more responsive, innovative and effective governance. Similarly the development of an authentically participatory process links directly to the two grand challenges prioritised by the Australian government, i.e. 1) ""Improving Public Services"" - especially health, education, and water - by fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation; 2) ""More Effectively Managing Public Resources"" includes measures that address budgets, procurement, natural resources and foreign assistance.

An excellent model for a participatory process of engaging with large numbers of citizens in the development of a national food policy is the People's Food Policy Project of Canada, which produced the ground-breaking report: ""Resetting the Table"": http://foodsecurecanada.org/people-food-policy. This was adapted at a smaller scale in Australia in 2012-3 by the Australian Food Sovereignty Alliance with the development of the People's Food Plan for Australia: http://www.australianfoodsovereigntyalliance.org/peoples-food-plan/. Earlier participatory policy development processes that had significant and important outcomes, as well as very well-regarded and transparent processes, were the Purple Sage project - https://vwt.org.au/1998/11/purple-sage/ - and the WaterMark project - https://vwt.org.au/2007/11/water-mark/ - both led by the Victorian Women's Trust. 

As a first step, I would encourage the Australian government to endorse the Urban and Regional Food Declaration, which has been developed by Sustain: The Australian Food Network (www.circlesoffood.org) and can be read here: http://www.circlesoffood.org/urban-and-regional-food-declaration/.

8.11,"Public participation principles: Public participation in government needs clear definition of what ‘government’ is. The Parliament and executive government have been elected to act on behalf the people – they need to be kept accountable and responsible for their decisions. The administrative arm of government is usually tasked with the research (including community consultation and engagement), development (including co-design and collaboration) and implementation of policies, services, programs, etc. 

Public Participation in each of these two ‘government’ arenas should not have a blanket approach applied. 

We need to be sure the differences are articulated and then a set of principles is developed to be applied to each. These principles should include, at the core, a commitment to open government and public participation and should be underpinned by a diversity, inclusion and human rights framework.

8.13,"Public Advisory Panel: Public participation in government should be in public hands.
There should be a peak public organization – called, say, Public Advisory Council (PAC) - which:
• monitors government activities
• maintains a data base of public organizations and individuals with interests in particular issues
• assesses which government activities appear to require public participation
• determines the nature and extent of the participation needed
• advises interested public organizations and individuals about the requirement
• assists organization and individuals in preparing material and participating, particularly those with limited resources
• collects, collates and analyzes material from them
• also, of its own volition, collects, collates and analyzes material including by professionally conducted, reliable and valid quantitative and qualitative surveys (as advocated by Bob Douglas in his suggestion)
 with the use of unprofessional surveys, as currently are prolific and which misrepresent public opinion, being proscribed
• prepares and makes submissions based on that information 
• prosecutes the public case with government, opposition and cross-bench Members of Parliament.
The system would not preclude interested organizations and individuals from making their own submissions and representations.
The PAC could also act unilaterally if it identified an activity in which no known public organizations or individuals had an interest.
Advantages would include:
• the potential for a single, powerful submission embracing a wide-range of public opinion, simplifying the task of government.
• resourced-starved Opposition and cross-bench MPs would receive the same powerful submission rather than a collection of submissions with which they have to deal.
• (One of the first issues the PAC should deal with would be the lack of resources available to Opposition and cross-bench MPs – democracy would be enhanced if they were to have far greater resources)
• most importantly, public participation would be controlled by a public organization, devoid of government involvement
This would be a major organization which would be:
• financed by government using a fixed formula which guarantees minimum funds
• staffed by a highly-qualified meritocracy of personnel from a multiplicity of disciplines
• have a structure which would enable it to cover all government activities e.g. it could have as many advisory panels as there are ministerial portfolios.
This suggestion arises from a decade of individual advocacy for greater public/client involvement and benefits in legal regulation, stemming from being a victim of a major fraud in an Adelaide law firm’s trust accounts.
The fraud exposed the near-monopoly in the development and administration of legal regulatory systems (they are state and territory responsibilities).
This has always been a case of the lawyers of governments (attorneys-general) and the lawyer organizations (national and state/territory) collaborating – with the public and clients (who are forced to pay for more than 80% of the systems) being allowed negligible consultation.
The resulting bills are them marshalled through parliaments by the attorneys-general largely backed by lawyer MPs. Or, in the case of the Legal Profession Uniform Law launched last year by NSW and Victoria, “guillotined” through the parliaments.
The lawyers call this “co-regulation” but it seems more a case of an abuse of power and authority, damaging the principle of the separation of powers.",Public Participation,,

8.18," I recently read the unflinching external review report on the DTO's Gov.au ""alpha"" release [www.dto.gov.au/standard/assessments/gov-au-alpha/] and it made me wonder what would happen if we applied the discipline and structure of good digital asset design - in this case, rebuilding the federal government's web front end - to the business of policy making.

The question forms part of a longer standing speculation about the relative lack of progress we've witnessed in the application of the tools, culture and practice of ""digital transformation"", which have mostly been used in a service delivery context, to the way we conceive of, and execute, the policy process. 

By and large, the deeper reaches of the policy world have been relatively ""transformation free"", at least in the sense we've witnessed how the mantra of digital disruption has upset many of the instincts and habits of work in other part of the public sector. That has been the result, I think of a mix of pragmatism (start at the relatively easy end of the spectrum with service delivery) and more or less stout resistance from those anxious, for a whole range of reasons, to preserve and entrench the inviolability, and even elements of the mystery of their work. 

What struck me about the external review report, written by reviewers from the UK's Government Digital Service (on which the Australia DTO has been closely and deliberately modelled), is the combination of three factors which framed the task of designing and implementing a digital service or asset.

The first factor is an agreed, accessible and authoritative basis of design 'rules' and principles that define the context and process of design, build and implementation; in this case, the whole process is governed by the DTO's design rules. 
The Digital Service Standard [www.dto.gov.au/standard] consists of 14 principles or criteria against which all digital design and delivery should be judged. Their purpose is simple:
The Digital Service Standard establishes the criteria that Australian Government digital services must meet to ensure our services are simpler, faster and easier to use. Meeting the criteria means we can consistently provide high quality services and satisfy our users’ needs.
Some of the criteria include ""understand user needs"", ""...use an agile and user-centred approach,"" ""measure user satisfaction and... measure and report other metrics publicly"" and ""make sure the service is simple enough that users success first time unaided.""

The second factor is an open process of external review designed to hold the people doing the actual work to account. But, although the approach can be tough and uncompromising, it doesn’t appear to be undertaken in a traditional ""audit"" mode which often privileges the search for mistakes and someone to blame. In this case especially, the report seems to be a genuine process of shared learning to speed up the process of getting to a successful conclusion.

The third factor is what I would describe as radical legibility. This implies going beyond the important, but lower standard of visibility or even transparency, but to make the process of development and critical review as open and public as possible so people can literally ""read"" what's going on and have half a chance of understanding it, and therefore assessing its value.

I appreciate there are libraries of text books and handbooks that spell out the way policy should or could be done, in different contexts. But as I read the GDS report – clear, direct, unwavering and helpful – I wondered what would happen if the three elements that framed this project - agreed design rules or principles, external, open and expert review and radical legibility - were accepted as the basis on which, in most cases, policy development is undertaken?

The question engages the movement for ""open policy"" which now has at least a foothold in some public sector contexts. 
For example, there is an open policy program in the UK civil service, [www.openpolicy.blog.gov.uk] defined as ""better policy making through broadening the range of people we engage with, using the latest analytical techniques, and taking an agile, iterative approach to implementation.""

As part of the program, there is an open policy making kit UK [www.gov.uk/guidance/open-policy-making-toolkit/getting-started-with-open-policy-making.] The kit reflects a view that open policy making is about:
…developing and delivering policy in a fast-paced and increasingly networked and digital world through:
• using collaborative approaches in the policy making process, so that policy is informed by a broad range of input and expertise and meets user needs
• applying new analytical techniques, insights and digital tools so that policy is data driven and evidence based
• testing and iteratively improving policy to meet complex, changing user needs and making sure it can be successfully implemented.""

The Institute of Government in London has written a report on open policy making [www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/opening-policy-making]. 
It points out that “more open policy making is counter-cultural.” For the most part, the report goes on to explain that “the policy-making norm is for policy to be developed in one government department (or maybe by a number of departments, under a lead), behind closed Whitehall doors. That policy will then go for sign-off through the Cabinet Committee process. There will then be a 12-week consultation on a document that sets out the Government’s approach. If the Government needs to legislate there may (or may not) be a draft bill and pre-legislative scrutiny.”

Making the process more open and porous requires different skills from civil servants, who need to be what the report describes as “enablers and expert process designers rather than trying to monopolise the policy making input behind closed doors”. They also require ministers to be clear about areas that are off limits, but also to be prepared to engage with a much more open mind on issues that are in play.

The recent social policy framing paper from the ALP, released rby Jenny Macklin [http://cdn.australianlabor.com.au/documents/Growing-Together.pdf] includes a significant set of commitments to what the same instincts as these earlier examples of open policy making. 

To that extent, the paper reflects a deal of dissatisfaction with a policy process seen often to be distant from, and perhaps even disrespectful to, those whose expertise and experience is often either diminished or excluded altogether and, even more, from those meant to be the beneficiaries. 

The paper notes, in common with most policy discussions these days, that governments alone cannot tackle all of society’s challenges. It argues that “families, neighbourhoods and grassroots organisations are the backbone of strong and cohesive communities” and that “local issues often have local solutions, and they should always have local input.” 

The problem is that, too often, “policy development… exists in a vacuum, removed from experts outside government, organisations that deliver services, and most importantly, the people that policies affect.” 

The ALP social policy framework accepts that “politicians are frequently seen as too far removed from the people most affected by the decisions they make.” Too rarely do we have open, public debates about the kind of society we want to live in, and how we can create it.

It goes on:
“Strengthening citizen engagement in politics and policy development enhances the quality of those debates. It also recognises that governments do not have a monopoly on ideas. There are plenty of important actors in civil society – community groups, trade unions, Indigenous and culturally diverse organisations, business, churches and philanthropic foundations. All of these groups and more have a role to play in coming up with good ideas and creating positive change.”

It notes that, in the UK, a debate is underway about how governments can facilitate “a shift away from a reliance on centralised control over service provision, to a greater emphasis on local leadership and community-controlled service management and delivery.” It concludes that “increasing centralisation of power and control can lead to narrow forms of governance that are too far removed from the people impacted by decisions of government.”

You get the point. And the real point of the argument in this part of the policy framework is this:

Australia has a history of devolving responsibility for service delivery to non-government agencies. Not-for-profit and community sector organisations are funded to deliver services for disadvantaged groups. More recently, for-profit businesses have been contracted to deliver employment services or aged care. However, these models rarely devolve responsibility for policy development, program design or decision making. (Italics added)

And to reinforce these insights, a recent report from the UK’s Institute for Public Policy Research, The Condition of Britain [www.ippr.org/files/publications/pdf/the-condition-of-britain_June2014.pdf?noredirect=1] argues that “too much power continues to be hoarded by politicians and civil servants at the centre of government, and too little is in the hands of the people and places that could do the most with it.”

These manifest deficiencies in the policy making process point to at least of the elements of digital asset design and delivery that the Gov.au initiative has used to ensure an impact that is in line with the DTO’s mandate – to make services clearer, simpler and faster. To the extent that the open policy making critiques imply a more complete devolution of power and control in shaping and making policy, it implies the need for an approach which is more in line with the way DTO is prosecuting its work.

One of the most recent, and one of the best, expositions of the urgent need to invent some new practices and tools of open policy making, along the lines of the DTO’s framework, is a book based on her work with the GovernaceLab at New York University [www.thegovlab.org/] by former Deputy CTO for Open Government in the first Obama administration, Beth Noveck.

The book Smart citizens, smarter state: the technologies of expertise and the future of governing http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286054 offers a persuasive critique of many of the aspects of current and traditional policy making against whose baleful consequences the open policy movement is working.

In many ways, Noveck’s argument goes wider and deeper than many of the earlier examples. She certainly pushes the discussion beyond the more or less creative use of traditional means of making government more porous, including things like using consultations to seek feedback on draft policy papers, inviting people to sit on various types of expert panels and committees, including (in the Australian context) royal commissions. Her careful analysis makes the case for a more profound shift in the architecture of power, authority and participation, akin perhaps (by her own analogy) to the introduction by Henry II in England of the jury as an integral part of the justice system. 

Noveck’s point is that too much deep expertise and experience is being systematically omitted from the policy making process because (a) it is, almost by definition, diffuse and distributed and (b) what she describes as the ""technologies of expertise"", which are already proving themselves adept at the task of finding, curating and connecting requisite expertise (properly understood) for better problem solving, have not yet infiltrated deeply enough into the rhythms and contours of the policy making process.

At base, she argues that our problem is that, even those of us who might consider ourselves ardent democrats waiver in our faith “that citizens possess the knowledge and the competence needed for participation in governing.” The answer is to go beyond old fashioned politics and ballot counting “to build conversational infrastructure that connects diverse people and what they know to our public institutions""

What we’ve developed over time (and many of the examples in the book are drawn from the US) is a decidedly random or “broken, staccato rhythm” of citizen engagement. The consequence is that we’ve become inured to a system in which “people are infrequently asked to do more, to participate in deliberative polls or citizen assemblies, they are asked to watch, but not to act, to keep government accountable, but not to join in...""

New networked technologies allow us to transcend the anachronistic reflex of policy making because they “allow us to divorce the concept of expertise from elite social institutions and [create] tools to enable neural identification of talent and inability - whether of those inside or outside government, with credentials of craft knowledge…”

Beth Noveck argues here, as she has before in her work on “wiki” government [www.amazon.com/Wiki-Government-Technology-Democracy-Publications/dp/0815702752] that we have reached a stage where it is not just possible, but increasingly imperative, to make government and governing both more participatory and more expert. 

She makes this point:
""If [people] have knowledge relevant to governing and problem solving - whether or not they are part of a credentialed elite - they will get called upon more often and given more responsibility in much the same way that meritocracies emerge in open source programming...it does establish hierarchies of responsibility and talent; it does create its own forms of elites. But the opportunity is distributed, decentralised and open to all.""

The problem, she argues, is not professionalism per se but one of “exclusionary and exclusive practices that limit participation and collaboration with those outside government, including other elites and credentialed professionals as well as those with practical know-how.""

This is the way IPPR's The Condition of Britain report I quoted earlier puts the same idea...

A process of social and economic renewal must seek to marshal all of the resources that reside in everyday life, harnessing people’s time and talents, and drawing on the strengths and experience of civil society in all its forms. This will require steps to both promote and reward contribution across society, strengthen civic and state institutions that mobilise contribution, and embed reciprocity much more strongly in our welfare system.

What this points to is the need to experiment with new ways of tackling public problems and a different way of doing public work. What Beth Noveck, the IPPR report, the ALP’s new social policy framework anf the other examples I’ve drawn from all reinforce is the need to rethink how we conceive of, and then execute, a shared “public purpose” at the heart of our collective lives. It is akin to the call by Indian entrepreneur, public policy academic, politician and scientist Ashwin Mahesh [www.ashwinmahesh.in] to adopt an approach which reflects this insight:

“More than looking for solutions, what we need today is to increase the number of problem-solving people. Each one of us can be a change-maker.”

I am not arguing that all policy all of the time can be open policy. Clearly, there are situations where a requisite discretion, even secrecy, has to be expected. I’m not advocating the replacement of one unhelpful orthodoxy with another.

But I am suggesting that it would be worth some experiments to see how to translate the kind of open, rigorous, collaborative and honest approach to which DTO is subjecting itself in much of its work, including the reflexive and promiscuous use of the tools, platforms and mindsets of genuine digital disruption, to the way we develop and design policy.

8.19,"Provide a way for citizens to easily engage electronically with government agencies. To engage with citizens government agencies needs ways to know who they are talking to. Another way of expressing it is that citizens need ways to tell agencies who they are.
There are two general approaches to identification. One approach is the single identity approach. This is often called single signon.

The alternative approach is to take advantage of existing identity systems. This approach gives citizens ways to link their existing identities. Using this approach a citizen can identify themselves to an agency. Once identified with one agency the citizen can reuse their identity with other agencies.

This approach leaves data in data silos. It protects data through the use of approved applications. It provides a private secure identity system. It requires no new legislation or regulations. It is low cost. The system is agnostic to who owns the data silos. This means it integrates with civil society and with private industry identity systems.

An action item for OGPau is to.

Trial a system where citizens have access to information about themselves in existing systems. Citizens verify their identities each time they engage with an agency. A citizen's online identity is the combination of all existing identities. 

(note privacy principle 12.4b states that an organization holding data about a person should: ""give access to the information in the manner requested by the individual, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so"".)

Once a person has a connection with two agencies the person can copy data from one agency to the other. The trial system will do this for any task requiring the reuse of personal information. There are hundreds of potential trial situations.

The savings generated from the first implementations can fund implementations for other applications. The government will only need to seed fund the first application.

8.19.1,"An alternative to this action item that achieves the same purpose.

For Open Government to work we need citizen engagement. The mechanics of engagement matters. Personal data in government systems are in self contained data silos. Taxation data is separate from Health data which is separate from Law Enforcement etc. For a meaningful engagement with citizens it is important to maintain these silos.

The Australia Card and other national id proposals were attempts to link data silos. The reasons to do this were claims of efficiency of administration. But, when we hard link personal data silos the efficiencies prove to be imaginary. This happens because the functions performed within the data silos interact. These interactions make it difficult for each individual system to change and adapt. The interactions increase costs that soon overwhelm any savings.

In Australia the latest attempts to integrate data silos are mygov and ehealth. Both have proved to be expensive and have increased costs. This has happened because both use the same identity across personal data silos. This creates a hard link across silos. A hard link is when something about a person changes in one silo it changes in the other silo. 

Both mygov and ehealth are being overhauled. These attempts will have limited success. The reason is that the overhauls continue to use a common identity.

The alternative to using a common identity is to continue to use different identities for different data silos. To communicate across silos we link common data across data silos. But we do it without using a common identity. This is a weak link because changing data in one silo may not change it in other silos.

Open Government initiatives will fail if citizen engagement uses one identity for all engagement. The Open Government movement should use different identities for different engagements. It is important to maintain personal data silos for different government services. 

A possible action item for Open Government is.

Open Government engagement uses different personal identities for different types of engagement.",Public Participation,,

Having a centralised system to track and coordinate engagement activities and enable the sharing of data collected across agencies and projects will also make the time and money invested into participation in engagement more efficient for both stakeholders and government. It will enable greater coordination when addressing social issues, measure and monitoring social impacts and outcomes, and refine services and programs. 

These systems and processes need to be designed with respect to privacy, enabling consent and self-service and by segregating data and user access, but they are essential if we want to build on existing data, understand trade offs and impacts, and work together more effectively to address complex problems. They enable participation beyond consultation and are necessary for collaboration - across agencies and with parties outside of Government. 

Systems implemented will need to enable the analysis and reporting of both qualitative and quantitative data, AND support communications and the management of relationships generated through engagement.

Currently, the polling of the Australian population about their concerns and aspirations is undertaken by political parties, media groups and those with a particular axe to grind. 
Many of us have our own view about why the Australian electorate is currently disenchanted with our democracy but we lack the essential data, based on neutrally funded and neutrally conducted, comprehensive, systematic surveys. 

I propose that the Commonwealth Electoral Commission, should, every three years, commission a statistically valid random sample of voters from each Australian electorate to be interviewed using an interview schedule, which asks open questions about general life satisfaction, work/life balance, childcare, employment opportunities, education opportunities, health care experience, political representation, views on the environment, defence policy and spending, levels of taxation, housing opportunities, transport infrastructure, community engagement, sense of security, the role of government and the private sector and the basic assumptions underpinning the operation of the economy. 

The results of this survey should be made available to every voter, in the period that precedes the subsequent federal election. We all accept our responsibility to be counted in the census. I suspect that most Australians would similarly welcome the possibility of providing their views in this way as their contribution to open government.

How can a community vote on complex subjects?

8.28,"Australian Wisdom Network ( www.wisdom.to/australia ) : The Zero Marginal Cost path to Society Growth, universal public participation, democratisation of every sector and economic/government transformation. ""Today, the main contradiction in modern capitalism is between the possibility of free, abundant socially produced goods, and a system of monopolies, banks, and governments struggling to maintain control over power and information .... Everything is pervaded by a fight between network and hierarchy. Paul Mason""

'You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete' R. Buckminster Fuller.

The Australian Wisdom Network ( www.wisdom.to/australia ) is a new model based upon Zero Marginal Cost Network to crowd create economic transformation, government transformation and Network Society and achieve Society Growth for all Australians.

Australian Wisdom Network applies the Network Society development model to deliver the ""1 Australia in 1 Global Village"" objectives of 'Society Growth', Minimum Life (enhanced Basic Income, Economic Transformation, Government Transformation and to accelerate the evolutionary Shift from Industrial Economy to Network Society. Zero Marginal Cost Networks (internet, massively scalable 'blockchainified' databases, wisdom networks, mobile devices, distributed apps, distributed databases, open source software etc) and the resulting Network Society development model offer a superior, efficient, effective global and costless means to organise society (sectors, countries and the Global Village) and focus community wisdom on society outcomes and a Minimum Life (enhanced 'Basic Income') for everyone.

If Australians sat down with a blank sheet of paper today, this is the 'Australia' they would design for tomorrow. It is a quick, easy and comprehensive paradigm (or platform) shift using current technologies. Simply, every 'thing' in every sector across society has a virtual representation in a society-wide, blockchainified, massively scalable databases accessible to everyone. Wisdom Networks organise and focus the wisdom of crowds around every 'thing' in society, everywhere for everyone via mobile devices. The outcome is a real-time, Zero Marginal Cost, transparent and accessible Network Society that delivers a Third Industrial Revolution jump in productivity and quality of life for everyone. The crowd can begin with a small problem and expand to sector, country, region and the Global Village.

Australian Wisdom enables the 3rd Industrial Revolution, distributed prosperity, distributed governance, economic transformation, government transformation, all-inclusive citizen empowerment, democratisation across every sector, regional/global integration, regional integration and accelerates the shift towards a Network Society and a global humanitarian platform.

The purpose of a Network Society is 'Society Growth' by maximising collective wisdom, collective prosperity and collective satisfaction at ‘Zero Marginal Cost‘ in sectors, countries and the Global Village for everyone, everywhere. Network Society consolidates all 8 types of capital underlying prosperity and 6 types of wisdom in a few networks to crowd create satisfaction and a Minimum Life (enhanced Basic Income for everyone) at 'Zero Marginal cost', rather than exponential fragmentation, centralisation and high marginal cost of the Industrial Economy. It can be launched in 90-180 days. Transformation in 2-5 years.

Australian citizens could also participate directly in export markets by offering their services abroad. First mover advantage is important.

The OGP Declaration by Governments includes a commitment to 'harness the power of new technologies to achieve outcomes of accountability, transparency, accessibility, democratisation, foster innovation, greater prosperity, well-being, prosperity, public participation and to empower and delivers for citizens.

The Industrial Economy model simply can not achieve these outcomes given the underlying use of centralisation, fragmentation and monetisation of society's things and isolation of information remote from the people that need it. Zero Marginal Cost Networks consolidate wisdom, prosperity and satisfaction in networks across every sectors accessible to all at a fraction of the cost of the Industrial Economy development model.

Only new technologies (like Zero marginal Cost technologies) and a new model can achieve the OGP commitments within the OGP declaration.

8.28.1,"Comment on the ideal organisation to deploy was also requested. 

The ideal organisation to deploy Australia Wisdom (within government) would be the Digital Transformation Office. Approximately, 30 people would be required and it would cost a few million dollars. In its current form, the DTO is a service provider to other government departments. Other government departments still make the decisions as to the degree of transformation that the DTO can enable.

The DTO may need to follow the Malaysian model and be given statutory powers to implement Australian Wisdom across government. A discussion of the Australian vs Malaysian approaches is provided in the article 'What is Transformation? 4 Purposes of Government ‘Transformation’ departments (theatre, advisory, incremental, metamorphosis). Examples: Australia, Malaysia' at http://www.wisdom.to/transformation.html .

In fact, Australian Wisdom can operate independently of government. It can be launched and the people use it directly to manage their 'things' across sectors in society (health, education, equity market, innovation, governance, government etc). People can add their 'things'. Australian Wisdom can also scrape things from the internet. 

Deployment and direct benefit to citizens is not conditional upon government involvement. However, it is appropriate for government to implement Australian Wisdom society wide. Government defines the rules of society and has a significant impact on structure. It can legislate the stump jump plough (Industrial Economy) or the Combine Harvester (Network Society). Perhaps, the time is right to structure society as networks given the recent drive to transform Australia. Government could transform Australia very quickly. It will take decades for undercapitalised entrepreneurs to achieve the same outcome using a bottom up approach.",Public Participation,,
8.28.2,"There is another deployment option that may be more appropriate given the responsibility for Society is divided across government departments (at federal, State and local levels). It may be simpler to just have one organisation like the DTO that launches one network and make it directly available to all Australian citizens. However, it could also be done incrementally by individual government departments. A Wisdom Network could be downloaded by anybody in Australia (just like Wordpress for web sites) and deployed by the smallest or largest communities with a common interest. These individual communities then mesh into the larger Australian Wisdom over time.

In this comment, we'll introduce an Australian people-driven society, provide a quick sector overview and then provide specific wisdom networks that could be launched by various Australian government departments. Any of these could spawn or be part of the Australian Wisdom Network. Without proactive action by Australian government, it will take decades for undercapitalised Australian entrepreneurs and citizens to achieve the Network Society. With proactive action by the Australian government, Australia could accelerate the inevitable evolution from Industrial Economy to Network Society and usher in a new era of prosperity.

Society Growth is people driven by real-time citizen demand (citizen participation and contribution) in wisdom networks across society

SOCIETY GROWTH IS PEOPLE DRIVEN BY REAL-TIME CITIZEN DEMAND (CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND CONTRIBUTION) IN WISDOM NETWORKS ACROSS SOCIETY
The 'Industrial Economy' model for determining '(economic) growth' is planned and expanded by government and industry which organises money, infrastructure, hierarchy, centralised decision making, annual planning cycles and markets to determine society focus and expansion. The people in a Network Society drive Society Growth with real-time knowledge, planning, effort and broad consensus captured and applied in all 'Community of Common Interest' wisdom networks across society. Priorities, effort and outcomes are determined by real-time citizen activity across society in real-time networks.

Any individual could download and deploy a wisdom network in 90-180 days to focus wisdom to focus local, national or global wisdom on community of common interest, society problem, need or challenge. Society Growth is dynamically with real-time citizen demand for network features, sector, country, regional and global networks satisfied by any individual creating a wisdom network in 90-180 days.
Entrepreneurs, governments, telcos and industry build a supply of wisdom networks that present the people and society with opportunity for Society Growth. Wisdom Network demand (citizen participation and contribution) determines where society expands by prioritising features, functions, wisdom and effort amongst competing local, sector, country and global networks. Wisdom networks can be launched in 90-180 days and achieve local, sector, country or global transformation in 1-5 years.

Rather than voting for between policies of two political parties, annual planning cycles and capital allocation based upon return on Investment, Society Growth is determined by real-time wisdom network demand (citizen participation and contribution) and supply (proposals to society by anyone) determines community consensus in real-time across sectors, countries and globally. The many (rather than the few) collectively determine the features, functions and growth path of society in Zero marginal Cost networks.

Wisdom networks are the foundation for real-time people-driven Network Society. Government can focus on governance as the responsibility of organising society is returned to the people.

SECTOR OVERVIEW
The method of combining 'things' into books and sharing them across every sector is universally applicable to organise wisdom.

Some examples:
- Health Wisdom doctors, nurses and patient crowd creating health (via HealthBook)
- Education Wisdom: teachers, parents and students crowd creating education ( via EducationBook)
- Equity Market Wisdom: companies, advisers and investors crowd creating IPO's, ventures, trade sales and innovation
- Democracy Wisdom: politicians and citizens crowd creating real-time citizen participation and democracy (via PoliticiansBook and Network Democracy
- Government Wisdom: politicians, bureaucrats, citizens and industries crowd creating governance and services outcomes
- Governance Wisdom: governance is about directing effort to prioritised, merit based outcomes. Wisdom Networks reveal perfect knowledge and optimise action.
- Management Wisdom: directors (direct), managers (manage and review) and executives (execute) crowd create management and leadership within an organisation with a 3 role flat management structure
- Regional integration: people across regions can exchange wisdom about any ""thing"" in any sector
- Global/Humanitarian: any person anywhere around the world can participate, contribute or seek humanitarian assistance from any sector in any Network Society

Each of the sectors above could be the responsibility of individual government departments. Each sector wisdom network could stand-alone and, ultimately, simply become a mesh of wisdom networks across Australian society. Australian Wisdom could start with the networks that deliver the most benefits for Australians in the shortest period of time.

We will provide a few examples of potential applications of Australian Wisdom. People assemble 'things' in Australian Wisdom. This means there aren't applications built for a specific purpose. There are combinations of 'things' driven by citizens within the community that have unlimited combinations. Millions of customised 'applications' are replaced by dynamically combining 'things' into books and sharing them. Australian's do this every day with their social lives. Why did this evolution stop at social? The same process can apply to every other sector of society with profound implications for productivity, transparency and Society Growth.

DEPARTMENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET
Network Democracy ( http://www.wisdom.to/networkdemocracy ) is a combination of Government Wisdom, Governance Wisdom and Democracy Wisdom. 

One Network Democracy network could provide comprehensive citizen participation, governance, transparency, wisdom and access to government and industry. Stage 1 would deliver Government Wisdom with a specific focus on collective governance and transparency across government. Stage 2 could deliver broader citizen participation. Stage 3 could deliver build on collective government wisdom and include the democratic process. Additional stages could include collective governance of critical sectors and other aspects of society.

The Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet could be the kernel of Australian Wisdom. Australian Wisdom could start here with a Government Wisdom platform that assembled 'things' across government department agencies (eg; governance and financial reports). This would provide a real-time view of government for not only those within government, but also provide citizens with real-time transparency and the opportunity for participation and contribution by citizens in their chosen area of competence and interest.

Comprehensive information is available at http://www.wisdom.to/networkdemocracy .

HEALTH WISDOM, FEDERAL HEALTH, NEHTA, PCEHR
For example, the Federal Health Department (or NEHTA) could deploy Health Wisdom ( http://www.wisdom.to/health ) which provides enables participation, collaboration and contribution between doctors, nurses and patients. 

It would also come ""Over the Top"" of the existing PCEHR and add wisdom, collaboration and universal access to Australia's PCEHR which has simply centralised health information, but does not provide a value proposition to drive usage by patients, doctors, nurses and other care givers.

AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL COMMISSION
The Australian Electoral Commission could deploy Democracy Wisdom ( http://www.wisdom.to/democracy) which would provide real-time transparency, participation, collaboration and contribution for the democractic process, politicians, government executives, participatory budgeting, meeting minutes, procurement process transparency, expenses, audit tralil of ‘things’ in Politicians Books and every 'thing' in democracy. Please read http://www.wsidom.to/networkdemocracy .

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
Education Wisdom - crowd creates collective education, global research and industry integration. Education Wisdom exchanges all 6 elements of wisdom between students, teachers, parents, industry, researchers around the world in real-time via mobile devices by applying the Network Society development model

Additional information is available from http://www.wisdom.to/education .

DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND SCIENCE
Equity Market Wisdom ( http://www.wisdom.to/equitymarket ) crowd creates innovation, ventures, SME’s, public companies, capital allocation, governance, market transparency, meritocracy and market access globally. A single platform could provide a global functioning equity market and innovation system. This platform could be based anywhere and connect market participants (companies, advisers, investors, regulators and other stakeholders) globally. Equity Market Wisdom provides an efficient and effective platform for the private sector allocation of capital and focusing collective Australian Wisdom on innovation and other stages in the lifecycle of Australian companies. This platform supports commercialisation at every stage of a company/innovation lifecycle.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Australian Wisdom could achieve wisdom and prosperity for Australia's farmers by putting every 'thing' in a virtual network for seamless collaboration transparency amongst farmers, community, bankers, suppliers, brokers, wholesalers and other participants in Australian agriculture.

DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE - HUMANITARIAN AID
Humanitarian Wisdom ( http://www.wisdom.to/humanitarian ) reconstructs failed states, countries, sectors and societies in months (cold start) or weeks (hot start). Societies cease to function for a variety of reasons. In an Industrial Economy, the institutions that organises the economy and society simply cease to function in collapse, crisis, dysfunction or war. They are not resilient. The collapse of society and their economy is an all too common occurrence throughout history and models for reconstruction are haphazard. The physical and organisational infrastructure that has taken generations to develop ceases to function for the benefit of the people. Network Society development model offers a specific hot and cold start for failed states that mean reconstruction of society can take weeks/months, not decades.

Humanitarian Wisdom means Australian people help people around the world directly in every sector, collaborating with private bodies and NGOS globally, rather than aid provided from one government to another. The objective is to create Productive Knowledge fast that translates into humanitarian outcomes shaped by local needs and guided by global Productive KNowledge. A Network Society Development model can achieve a functioning society in months. It begins with the end in mind. The end is to organise Productive Knowledge, the foundation of society prosperity. Productive Knowledge is ""the social accumulation of things made productive in teams, organisations and markets"".

Productive Knowledge can be organised instantly using a Network Society development model, rather than rather than physical structures of the Industrial Economy development model which takes decades. The objective in crisis countries is the the creation of Productive Knowledge as fast as possible. The next stage is to add the modern elements to create a modern society with the benefit of a fully functional society operating in a network of people, their devices and a cloud app.

DEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Australian Wisdom would equalise service and community participation between city, regional and rural areas across Australia. With every 'thing' (people, data and service delivery) in networks, they are accessible to all Australians over the internet. Virtual organisation of society also reduce investment and pressure of expanding cities by providing opportunity and support in regional areas virtually.

DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE - COUNTRY, TRADE AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION
International integration is also faster and more effective by organising integration person to person. Regional Wisdom applies the Network Society development model achieve virtual, not physical, regional integration of markets, product, labour, services, democracy, industry, education, health and other key sectors.

Regional Wisdom uses wisdom networks (a virtual, not physical structure) to achieve regional integration of markets, product, labour, services, democracy, industry, education, health and other key sectors. Wisdom Networks provide a faster, cheaper way to integrate people, products, markets and sectors across regions or the world. Regional Wisdom enhances the depth, reach and time frame for integration. It moves beyond narrow regulatory and trade integration to providing a comprehensive wisdom (data, information, community, collaboration, knowledge, wisdom) network encompassing markets, products, energy, logistics, people and focus on any or all sectors with specific or all countries. Unlike Industrial Economy, it reaches the people and companies directly and immediately. It can assemble people and companies impacted by a new agreement quickly and deliver benefits fast. It could enable bilateral agreements, multilateral agreements or the ""Global Village'.

SUMMARY
In summary, Australian Wisdom could deployed by Australia's Digital Transformation Office (with upgraded statutory powers like Malaysia) or it could be deployed by individual government departments which provide a more efficient and effective means of achieving departmental objectives. In our estimate, a country or departmental wisdom network could be operated by no more than 30 people given activity, wisdom and prosperity is driven person to person within the community (not by people isolated from the community). The key is empowering citizens to drive their own wisdom, prosperity and satisfaction in every sector across Australian society and internationally.

Australian Wisdom simply provides a means for efficient and effective person to person interaction. History shows that prosperity of society is driven by the quality and quantity of person to person interaction. Centralist structures compromise this interaction. It is only by redefining person to person interaction throughout society and restructuring human time and attention that Australia will drive Society Growth (collective wisdom, prosperity and satisfaction). Australia organises their social life this way, the rest of society should be organised the same way.",Public Participation,,

8.30.1,"Note that this can be implemented in several ways.
1) Allocating a budget that community organisations could bid for, with a public assessment process and some form of voting on which grants are provisioned. This may need the establishment of a platform for civic bidding (several open source ones exist), which could be extended for state and local governments as a central capacity.

2) Pursuing a co-funding approach whereby agencies partner with a crowdfunding platform and nominate a program area. Prospective grant recipients put their projects on the crowdfunding platform and must raise a certain proportion of their needed funds from the public, at which point the government will provide a proportion. This approach has been used successfully by both the Tasmanian and WA governments in the last few years. it requires less infrastructure provision by government and mitigates some risk by demonstrating community support for the specific programs (through community crowdfunding dollars raised).
3) Providing funds to a third-party organisation which then manages the community-based participatory budgeting process. This approach allows a specialist to manage the voting process and provides independence from government political processes to create a perceptually fairer process and allows more expertise to be engaged in supporting the voting process (which is important as the public is not commonly used to this approach). It does require careful selection of the third-party to ensure perceptions of bias are minimised.",Public Participation,,

8.32,"Adopt IAP2 principles and standards for engagement practice: The International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) is the peak body representing engagement professionals around the world. A number of key principles have been developed globally that are recognised as best practice for engagement and public participation. IAP2 Australasia, is Australia and New Zealand’s leading Association advancing the practice of public participation.

IAP2 was founded on the belief that those who are affected by decisions have the right to be involved in the decision making process. Since 1998, IAP2 Australasia have been supporting people who implement public decision making processes by offering training and resources and promoting the principles of community and stakeholder engagement.

We are well known for our Core Values, Code of Ethics for practitioners and the Public Participation Spectrum. In 2014 it was recognised that the practice was changing and expanding to include community-led engagement and new tools and training have been developed to meet this need. The communities of Australia want to have their voice heard more than just at election time. IAP2 Australasia supports OGP in Australia for this reason and encourages all levels of government, and the private and not-for-profit sectors, to embed engagement principles into the fabric of decision making processes. 

Most recently IAP2 globally released the Quality Assurance Standard for community and stakeholder engagement, which can be used to measure any community engagement process. We encourage any actions under OGP to consider and implement this standard as the base or foundation framework. http://www.iap2.org.au/resources/quality-assurance-standard

IAP2 Australasia defines community and stakeholder engagement as a planned process with the specific purpose of working across organisations, stakeholders and communities to shape decisions or actions in relation to a problem, opportunity or outcome. 

IAP2's core values define the expectations and aspirations of the public participation process - all 7 must be considered in any engagement process. They can be found on Page 10 of the Standards above. Engagement practitioners agree to uphold these values and code of ethics (page 9). Across Australia we are seeing a significant increase in government agencies agreeing to these principles and undertaking training to ensure they can put these into practice.

The IAP2 Public Participation spectrum provides a quick reference to the levels of community engagement available to adopt. It recognises that not every project will require intense collaboration and some will require more than information delivery. It is about selecting the right level based on the needs/constraints of the decision maker and the potential impacts on stakeholders. Though the Spectrum is presented as linear it is not designed to indicate that you should move along the Spectrum. Each project, policy or decision may require a different level of influence from the stakeholders. This needs to be determined early in the process. http://www.iap2.org.au/resources/public-participation-spectrum

OGP Commitment activity suggestion
Need: Keeping and building on ‘corporate memory’
Activity to meet this need
Formal requirement for government staff, five years from retirement, to mentor younger employees for 12 months. Agreement of the organisation, retiring employee and the younger employee that ‘shadowing’ is an important work task of both employees and a formal part of their professional development. The basic process is below and this is expected to evolve through individual and organisation involvement and need.
1. 'Shadow' a senior government employee (who has more than 15 years of government work experience) with the senior employee purposefully showing and explaining their most valuable work tools and likely barriers;
2. Attend structured meetings to learn from the senior employees long-term lived experience of developing positive work relationships, dealing with intricate organisational knowledge, managing transitions and agile change. 

How it works
The mentoring program has rules and requirements similar to staff training but the content is the lived experience of the senior staff member's work history. Particularly the technological, social, political, work/home balance and economic capital useful in enabling more efficient organisation policies, plans and processes. This activity also refines career path planning and professional development decisions. I strongly suggest that more places for females and minority groups be allocated to this program to increase government staff diversity.
The benefit to the senior mentor includes reflecting upon new insights, perspectives, information offered by the younger person. Noting when their work and life experiences are of benefit and can improve current and planned projects. Also, as the senior employee retires, the organisation may decide to contract the retired person to ‘soft mentor’ senior executives.
Monitor and evaluate
Such employee interaction needs to be a work duty with details of how selection of mentor/mentee occurs, how work is planned with privacy/confidentiality clauses, the means to review progress and ways to stop the interaction when required. Reporting on the process is required at 3 month intervals. A common report is prepared as well as individual reports. Work completed during these interactions will carry both people's names for transparent recognition and appraisal. An employee who has observed the interactions is also required to evaluate the benefits, challenges and problems at 6 and 12 months.

9.4,"This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in government through its legislated role of setting records and information management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and preserving and providing a public right of access to government information.

Open government increases the transparency and accountability of government, encourages greater public engagement, strengthens governance and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key role in open government by promoting the creation, management and preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information, and facilitating access to this information.

The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and effectively covers all information created, used or received in the course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) (Archives Act), the National Archives:
•	identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
•	preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth accessible;
•	oversees Commonwealth records management;
•	determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
•	imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.

Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government policy. It is from this perspective and with this legislated role that the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on the Vision and the framework for the National Action Plan.

Vision
The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved management of, and accessibility to, information and records. A key element of this is a move to fully digital information management and business processes across the Australian government sector. This aligns with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading including earlier access to government records, the Digital Continuity 2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.

The National Archives also recommends that the Vision and Plan recognise Australia’s strong open government history, culture, initiatives and policies already in existence, including the Archives Act, to demonstrate Australia as a leading example of open government well before the Open Government Partnership came into being.

The government also recognises through legislation such as the Archives Act 1983, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 the need to restrict the circulation of some information for a particular time in order to protect the defence and security of the nation, its relationship with the world, and the privacy of citizens. The Archives Act entrusts the National Archives with this role in relation to government information and provides for the exemption from public release of a number of categories of information including national security, defence, international relations, confidential information, and personal affairs. When sensitivities lapse, information that was formerly withheld can be made available for access. The balance between the need to protect information from unauthorised use or accidental release, and open government principles should be considered in development of the Vision.

The Australian Government’s policy of open government is well established, and it is therefore well positioned to contribute to the Open Government Partnership and the National Action Plan. It will also be well positioned to target areas that require more effort to continue to advance open government in Australia. The National Archives has, and will continue to, play a key role in supporting open government initiatives by carrying out its core functions and by effectively contributing to Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership.

Framework
The National Archives supports the general framework outlined in the Australian Government National Action Plan template, and recommends a clear and strong statement of Open Government achievements to date from both a contemporary and historical context. We would particularly like to note Australia as one of the most open archival and government information access regimes in the world through the management, preservation and provision of access to government information under the Archives Act.

Established by the Act, one of the National Archives’ key roles is enabling public access to the archival resources of the nation. Through this role, the Archives has played a lead in open government and ensuring that citizens have access to the decisions and actions of their government, thereby supporting the rights and entitlements of individuals and promoting accountability and transparency.",Public Service Delivery,,

Meets principles: Transparency, Accountability, Public participation

Addresses Open Government Partnership Grand challenges: More Effectively Managing Public Resources

The creation, preservation and management of, and public access to, records and information is the cornerstone to transparency and accountability in the Australian government. These records and information provide evidence of decisions and actions of the Australian Government and are a unique source of information about the nature of the Commonwealth Government and its activities. Without robust information management in government, there is no transparency or accountability, no evidence of government decisions, and no protection of citizens’ rights and entitlements. Creating, preserving and managing these records and information digitally not only supports business efficiencies but also encourages citizen engagement and timely access to, and re-use of, Australian government information.

As the lead agency for information management in the Australian government, and the custodian of the most valuable government records, the National Archives will continue to move Australian government agencies to digital information management practices, implement strategies to support the ongoing preservation of, and timely access to, valuable digital government information, and participate in legislative reforms to streamline access to government information by citizens.

10.1,"Improve public access to information and increase public participation: OGP category - Legislative Openness, Access to Information, Open Data and Openness in Natural Resources areas

Suggestion:
To help better manage natural resources, the Government could improve transparency and community engagement by proactively publishing useful information about extractive industry and energy projects. To make it easy for citizens and industry to engage with natural resource development decisions, ensure open access to important information such as locations of activities and environmental reports.

Successful implementation
This could be achieved by creating a single open, national platform for mining and resources project information that contains up-to-date information about:
• the type of resource and project
• locations of proposed and current activity and infrastructure
• the decision-making process and applicable legislation
• status of projects
• links to public environmental and economic impact reporting
• company details
• links to community consultation events

Data and content on this platform will be available in a uniform, open, shareable format with permissible licences.

Context:
Most people don’t understand government and industry processes and rules. Information from government and industry is siloed, lacks context and not written in plain english. Current delivery mechanisms rely on domain knowledge and specialised software. Interrelated legislation is complex and varies by location. Company documentation and environmental reports are difficult to access.

People feel they are not part of, and cannot contribute to, decisions relating to their community or projects of national significance. When people do discover information either through the media or word of mouth, it is often too late to participate and have an impact on decisions. Situations escalate and clashes occur. 

Companies and governments at all levels struggle with communicating to many stakeholders across large distances. The lack of public participation and access to information impacts industry development and divides communities. Confusion around decision-making process impedes projects and diminishes trust in industry and government.

A single open, national platform for mining and resources project information will be beneficial in enabling community, government and industry to engage in informed dialogue around the sustainable development of Australia’s natural resources.

The service could assist with the implementation of  the Australian model of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard by capturing and displaying the relevant industry data in one place, in context with locations of activities and other company information.

Strategy:
• Develop a national, whole of government service publishing up-to-date project data.
• Service to aggregate relevant state and federal data.
• Develop contextual and educational content detailing process and legislation for each state/territory.
• Create a consistent, visual approach to displaying related data and content.
• Connect project data with existing environmental and economic reports.
• Connect projects with community consultation and engagement platforms.
• Republish data and content in open formats with permissible licences.

Tracking progress and measuring outcomes:
• Currency of data published
• Usage of service
• Engagement with stakeholders, published insights
• Increase in participation of community in decision making, earlier in process
• Industry engagement with and contribution to the service
• Number of projects listing community consultation/engagement actions

Agencies required to implement the idea:

The idea will require a lead agency. Each of the followings agencies can commit data and content to the idea, as well as being part of the implementation process:
- Industry, Innovation and Science (Mining and Resources/Innovation)
- Prime Minister and Cabinet (Whole of government)
- Department of Communications and the Arts (Whole of government)
- Department of Environment
- Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
- National Energy Resources Australia
- Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (EITI standard)
- CSIRO
- Geoscience Australia
- Chief Scientist

10.2,"Data management to assist Australia to meet its ‘Paris Agreement’ obligations: Executive Summary 

There is a need to strengthen the amount and quality of information on climate change that is collected, published and monitored for the Paris Climate Change Agreement. This is in harmony with Australia’s recent signature to the Open Government Partnership (OGP) being a voluntary, multi-stakeholder, international initiative intended to “promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance”. The OGP Agreement explicitly requires each country to “co-create a National Action Plan (NAP) with civil society.” It follows that members of civil society including individuals and climate action organisations are expected to contribute to the NAP.

To assess compliance with the Paris Agreement, Australia must produce and publish information on:
• what is being done,
• how well it being done, and
• what more needs to be done.








Lead Agency: Department of Environment

1) Justification
Australia and all other countries at COP21 (December 2015) committed to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. Fulfilment of the provisions of the Agreement is necessary but not sufficient to avoid catastrophic climate change. The crucial importance of the reduction in carbon emissions and the necessity of further action to keep global warming less than 20C above pre-industrial levels, preferably no more than 1.50C, is clearly stated in the preamble to the Agreement itself (Appendix 1).
The Paris Agreement requires countries to create, collect and share knowledge needed to plan, implement and monitor action to meet these global warming targets (Appendix 2). Australia, as one of the world’s leading sources of research and knowledge in climate change, has both a domestic obligation and a duty to the international community to develop and use these resources for the good of all.
The domestic obligation arises from the public trust exercised by public officers, in this case the Executive Government and its public servants. As public officers they owe a fiduciary duty to the people of Australia and must put the public interest ahead of all personal and other private interests. The wording of the Paris Agreement clearly indicates that it is in the public interest to act in accordance with the Agreement. This then justifies the commitment recommended below.
It is supported by the principle at international law that no country should act so as to harm the people of another country. Carbon pollution of the atmosphere spreads to affect every country. Furthermore, Weeramantry (1997 – then Vice-President of the International Court of Justice) argues that there is, in practice, recognition of an international legal principle that development should be sustainable, that is:
[the] correct formulation of the right to development is that right does not exist in the absolute sense, but is relative always to its tolerance by the environment. The right to development as thus refined is clearly part of modern international law. It is compendiously referred to as sustainable development (page 92).

That legal principle requires all countries to adopt and apply policies which are sustainable in respect of the atmosphere. The Paris Agreement is consistent with the principle. Australia must maintain and develop the necessary scientific research to generate the information needed to satisfy itself, other parties and civil society, that its policies and practices are adequate to honour commitments which it made under the Paris Agreement and to take corrective action if they are found to be inadequate.

2) Recommendations

That the Government establish and maintain access to a “Paris Agreement Implementation database” and public website with links to all data required to demonstrate Australia’s compliance with all terms of the Paris Agreement, constantly updated, including but not limited to:
1. Public policies (including economic policy), abatement targets, legislation, and other policy instruments (e.g. land use planning; building code) relevant to the Paris Agreement and to the transition to a low carbon economy, 
2. Each public agency responsible for conducting and/or monitoring measures for climate change mitigation and/or adaptation in accordance with the Paris Agreement,
3. Climate change strategies of each Federal Government agency, 
4. Each service and product offered by each public agency to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption,
5. A national inventory report of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases (as provided for in the Paris Agreement), 
6. Databases including past and current measurements and estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and abatement, environmental, social and economic impacts of climate change and other relevant data, machine readable to facilitate downloading and independent analysis, 
7. Research findings, 
8. Other relevant research projects (completed and current) 
8. Progress towards meeting Australia’s intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), the Australian Bureau of Statistics to report annually as one of its standard reporting items (i.e. climate change to be embedded into the government’s standard reporting processes, the ABS being one of its main monitoring authorities), and the five-yearly report provided for in the Paris Agreement,
10. International agencies with which Australia is collaborating to conduct and/or monitor measures to curb climate change and relevant data e.g. IPCC Climate Change 2014 ‘Impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities’ Summary for policymakers,
11. Civil society organisations conducting and/or monitoring measures to curb climate change,
12. Provisions for public participation.
 

3) Verifiable & measurable milestones to fulfill Australia’s commitment
1. Establish a “Paris Agreement Implementation database’ and public website; populate website with data as recommended.
(New Commitment Start Date Spring 2016; End Date Spring 2017.)
2. Launch of Paris Agreement Database.

The purpose of the framework for transparency of support is to provide clarity on support provided and received by relevant individual Parties in the context of climate change actions under Articles 4, 7, 9, 10 and 11, and, to the extent possible, to provide a full overview of aggregate financial support provided, to inform the global stocktake under Article 14.",Resource Management,,
10.3,"Summary of Management of Resource teleconference 30/3/16. 10 people attended this teleconference: Ken, Kim, Michael, Jessie, Ash, Brett, Mel, Mark, Tim and I. The group discussed the EITI, how it might be implemented by the Australian Government and how it could improve transparency including disclosure of payments and company ownership, standards and data release. This discussion included the need for legislative changes and a multi-stakeholder group / centralised approach to meet EITI requirements. The group also felt that a centralised place for information about these kinds of resources and how they were being used and managed across Australia was necessary and that companies might be encouraged or required to publish data as well as open data from Government on this kind of platform. The group spoke to the need for increased access to open data and data standards to enable this. Participants also spoke to the metrics and the need to look at more than those required by the EITI/ transparency but also those that could support improved resource management in Australia and the measurement and management of local social and environmental impacts. The importance of this data and these kinds of platforms for transparency, to enable public participation and ensure accountability was emphasised. Amelia",Resource Management,,
10.4,"Coal Seam Gas Requirements: o Triple bottom-line assessment of local, state and national costs and benefits of coal seam gas production.
o A system for the fair and equitable distribution of revenues, royalties and benefits to affected landowners, constituencies, states and territories. 
o A system for reasonable prioritisation of Petroleum title allocation, with a focus on land fit for few alternative uses, and minimised risk and disruption to the environment, aquifers, agricultural farmland, and local residents.
o Long-range environmental impact assessments and impact mitigation strategies for the development of existing and future CSG export ports.
o An impact assessment, impact mitigation strategy and crisis management procedure addressing the significant increases in tanker and bulk carrier traffic through The Great Barrier Reef. Considerations should include impacts on the environment and other industries including fishing and tourism.
o Recommendations for suitable legislative changes to ensure socially and environmentally responsible current and future development of this fledgling industry. 
o A requirement that seams are tested for BTX prior to drilling. 
(Note: these hydrocarbons are soluble in water…); that BTX containing areas are excluded from development. 

• A revision to the PETROLEUM (ONSHORE) ACT 1991, enabling the better protection of landowner and locally affected constituent interests.

﻿Open Government Partnership
Meeting of the Inter-Departmental Committee
10:00am – 11:00am, Friday 19 August 2016
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
Meeting Room 6, Level 4, One National Circuit, Barton

MINUTES

1. Overview and update
PM&C provided an update on Australia’s process to join the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to date and outlined next steps to finalise our first National Action Plan, including:

submitting the National Action Plan to the Open Government Partnership by 1 November 2016 and the key final dates to meet this timeframe; 

focusing over the next two months on identifying where we can lift the ambition of the proposed commitments; and

working in close collaboration with civil society, including, but not limited to the Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network, building on earlier consultations.  

2. Consultation and stakeholder engagement
PM&C noted that co-drafting the National Action Plan with civil society is an essential aspect of the OGP, and updated IDC members on the establishment of a joint government-civil society Interim Working Group to assist with this process, including:

tabling a draft Terms of Reference for the Interim Working Group, and outlining the timeframes to finalise membership (aiming for 26 August 2016); and

noting senior government representation would be sought, reflecting the Government’s commitment to the OGP process.

PM&C noted that IDC members would be engaged throughout this process to provide feedback on proposed commitments relevant to their agency. Key agencies would be approached regarding participation on the Interim Working Group.

The IDC also discussed timeframes for implementation of the National Action Plan.



3. Proposed commitments for the National Action Plan 
PM&C noted the IDC would play an important role in helping identify potential commitments to lift the ambition of the National Action Plan. IDC members were asked to review the list of proposed commitments put forward by stakeholders and come back with views on areas that may be worth further exploring.

The IDC discussed that this would be Australia’s first National Action Plan and is intended to provide a foundation for further engagement with civil society, with new initiatives identified over time.

PM&C clarified that at this stage, it is expected that commitments will be funded from existing operational budgets in relevant government agencies.

Members discussed whether PM&C had already evaluated the list of commitments and had views on the direction of the National Action Plan. PM&C clarified that in the first instance it would rely on IDC members and civil society stakeholders to report back on the viability and feasibility of the proposed commitments. 

Action: IDC members will review the list of proposed commitments from stakeholders and provide comments to OGP@pmc.gov.au by COB Thursday, 25 August 2016.

4. Other business
PM&C updated members on the upcoming Open Government Partnership Global Summit, to be held in Paris, France in December 2016.

1. Welcome and introductions

The co-chairs welcomed members to the first meeting of the Interim Working Group and invited introductions.

The co-chairs noted that Ms McLeod, as the civil society co-chair, would lead discussion on substantive items on the agenda (including around identifying commitments).

The co-chairs noted that they expected frank discussions between members, and members would be encouraged to relay conversations and consult broadly with their networks.  

Members discussed the role of the Group to facilitate broader engagement and consultation. It was noted that civil society members would act in their capacity as private individuals, but bring the knowledge and experience from their connections with the wider public and civil society organisations.



2. Update on Australia’s process to join the OGP

Dr Kennedy provided an update on Australia’s process to join the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to date, including consultation undertaken by PM&C between December 2015 and April 2016.  He noted the break in consultation on the National Action Plan due to the Federal election and the commencement of the caretaker conventions. 

Dr Kennedy outlined next steps for the Group to help finalise Australia’s first National Action Plan which is due to be submitted to the OGP by 1 November 2016, including:

identifying the grand challenges and high priority commitments to be explored for potential inclusion in the National Action Plan; 
co-drafting the text of the draft National Action Plan, including the commitments; and
facilitating broader consultation and public comment on the commitments and the draft National Action Plan.

Dr Kennedy noted that this is Australia’s first National Action Plan, and will be used as a foundation for ongoing consultation and to identify further commitments to improve government transparency and openness over time. It was also noted that the final decision on the content of the National Action Plan will rest with the Australian Government.

3. Terms of Reference

Members discussed the draft Terms of Reference and suggested amendments to the criteria outlined in Clause 2b to:

include the language used by the OGP and the Independent Reporting Mechanism regarding the level of ambition and transformational impact of commitments;
capture the OGP requirement for measurable outcomes, or ‘SMART’ (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant and Time-bound) commitments; and
consider the need for the commitment in Australia or to support Australia’s leadership in the region.

Members also discussed the proposed decision-making process in Clause 8, with a suggestion that a majority of government and a majority of civil society members should be required to make decisions, rather than a 75% majority of all members.  Members also discussed the need to record dissenting opinions.

Action: the secretariat will circulate updated Terms of Reference and seek endorsement from members out-of-session.


4. Australia’s first National Action Plan
a. Grand challenges and themes

Members discussed the need for the National Action Plan to cover a broad range of open government issues, and not be limited to the two grand challenges previously selected (‘Improving Public Services’ and ‘More Effectively Managing Public Resources’). 

Members agreed that the selection of grand challenges should be considered at a later stage, with the initial focus being on developing ambitious commitments.

b. Identification of high priority commitments

Members agreed to focus discussion on the list of potential commitments identified in the agenda paper, and were also invited to identify other ideas, including from the summary of suggested commitments previously put forward by stakeholders. 

Members agreed the National Action Plan could usefully include commitments already made by the Government, where this would provide a means to maintain momentum and specify tangible milestones. 

Members agreed to further explore the list of potential commitments identified in Agenda Paper 4 in more detail at future meetings. Several items were opened for a brief initial discussion:

Dr Kennedy (PM&C) led a discussion on a potential commitment regarding Australia’s membership to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Members agreed this commitment could include specific milestones around joining and complying with 
the EITI. 

Ms Quinn (Treasury) led a discussion on a potential commitment to explore options for a beneficial ownership register for companies. Civil society members indicated a preference for a firm commitment to establish a register. It was noted that there are implementation and timing issues that require further discussion.

Ms Owens (PM&C) led a discussion on potential public data commitments, including: 
building public data infrastructure to improve accessibility and discoverability of data; 
identifying and releasing high-value datasets;
using data to foster innovation and economic growth; and 
working with civil society to progress the social licence on data sharing. 

Members also discussed issues around data quality, discoverability, usability, demand, engagement, skills and capability, use cases, integrity and sustainability. Members raised the need for government to provide certainty to businesses and the not-for-profit sector on the ongoing availability of data. Members also discussed the availability and use of data for transparency and accountability purposes.
Civil society members raised a number of other potential commitments for further discussion by the Interim Working Group: 

Dr Coghill outlined a proposal for enhancement of the ‘national integrity system’, including matters such as an upgrade of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity into an Australian Integrity Commission, bringing the regulation of political campaign funding up to international better practice, and supporting integrity reforms by the Houses of Parliament. Members agreed to further discuss the feasibility and details of this proposal at the next meeting.

Mr Timmins outlined a proposal on reviewing and reforming access to information laws and practice. Members agreed to further discuss the feasibility and details of this proposal at the next meeting.

Members agreed the secretariat would publish the list of potential commitments the Interim Working Group agreed to further discuss for public comment.

Action: the secretariat will publish the list of potential commitments on the OGP Australia blog for public comment. 

c. Structure of the National Action Plan

Due to time constraints, this item was not considered. 

5. Consultation and engagement

Members agreed the secretariat would seek views from the Group on their preferred approach to broader consultation and public engagement out-of-session.

Action: the secretariat will seek views and comments from members out-of-session.

6. Other business

Members discussed the need for continued face-to-face meetings, and video-conferencing facilities. Members also discussed the possibility of longer meetings.

Due to time constraints, other items were deferred to the next meeting.

﻿AGENDA ITEM 4
		Interim Working Group
5 September 2016

Australia’s first National Action Plan

Australia’s first National Action Plan is an opportunity for the Government and civil society to work together to enhance transparency, accountability, public participation and innovation in our country and region.

The Australian Government is committed to co-creating a plan that contains concrete and ambitious actions that build upon our long tradition of openness and transparency. Our first National Action plan will provide a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new open government initiatives over time.

Australia’s first National Action Plan is due for submission to the Open Government Partnership (OGP) by 1 November 2016. Participating countries work in a two-year National Action Plan calendar cycle, with our next plan due in mid-2018.

a. Grand challenges and themes
National Action Plan commitments must relate to at least one of the OGP’s five Grand Challenges: 

Improving Public Services—measures that address the full spectrum of citizen services (including health, education, criminal justice, water, electricity, telecommunications and any other relevant service areas) by fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation.
Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom;
More Effectively Managing Public Resources—measures that address budgets, procurement, natural resources and foreign assistance;
Creating Safer Communities—measures that address public safety, the security sector, disaster and crisis response, and environmental threats;
Increasing Corporate Accountability—measures that address corporate responsibility on issues such as the environment, anti-corruption, consumer protection, and community engagement.
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet originally suggested that Australia’s National Action Plan focus on the themes of Improving Public Services and More Effectively Managing Public Resources. A broader range of grand challenges could be considered, reflecting the breadth of potential commitments the National Action Plan may address. This could be further considered by the Interim Working Group at a future meeting, once the scope of commitments is clearer.


For discussion and decision:

What should be the approach to deciding the grand challenges?  



b. Identification of high priority commitments

The Terms of Reference ask the Interim Working Group to consider and prioritise commitments for potential inclusion in the National Action Plan, having regard to:
consistency and level of priority against the OGP principles (transparency, accountability, public participation, and technology and innovation);
the likelihood of implementation success;
the costs and benefits of the proposed commitments (including alternatives to achieve a similar outcome); and
the views of the relevant Australian Government agency.

The OGP’s Government Point of Contact Manual contains guidance on drafting National Action Plan commitments, as well as guidance on consultation and information about OGP timeframes. It suggests that National Action Plans should include 5 – 15 high quality commitments spread over multiple themes. The OGP team have collated all stakeholder suggestions for commitments (collected between November 2015 and April 2016) in the attached summary. 

The full text of public submissions is available on the Australian OGP blog. The Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network has also released the Towards an Open Government Manifesto, which contains thirteen priority commitments for further consideration by Government and civil society.

Based on the commitments suggested though the consultation process (including the workshop in April 2016) and following initial discussions with responsible government agencies, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has identified the following areas for further discussion with the Interim Working Group:

Finalise Australia’s membership to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 

Explore options for a beneficial ownership register for companies.
Note: Australia committed to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and to exploring options for a beneficial ownership register as part of the UK Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016. No commitments have been made around timeframes and milestones for these initiatives.
Assess Australia’s compliance with the Open Contracting Data Standard.

Explore options to improve public participation and engagement in Commonwealth policy development and decision-making.

Improve whistle-blowers protections in the corporate sector, noting the Government’s commitment to improve protections for whistle-blowers who report tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office.

Create, manage and preserve informational digitally to support transparency, accountability and citizen engagement.

Improve the availability and use of public data.

Establish a permanent mechanism for OGP consultation during implementation of the National Action Plan.

Establish metrics to assess public utilisation of information access rights.

Improve disclosure of grants information.

Support government agencies to digitally transform high volume services.

This list is intended to act as a starting point to facilitate discussion by the Interim Working Group when considering commitments to include in the National Action Plan. We welcome the Interim Working Group’s views on these and any other potential commitments. Once the broad scope of commitments is agreed, the detail of these commitments (including the text to be included in the National Action Plan) can be discussed at future meetings.

Additional commitments may also be proposed and considered throughout the National Action Plan development process. 

For discussion and decision:

Which commitments should be considered for further exploration and consultation?


c. Structure of the National Action Plan

It is proposed that Australia’s National Action Plan follow the template provided by the OGP.

The template has four sections:
introduction;
open government efforts to date;
National Action Plan development process; and
commitments.
Interim Working Group members are encouraged to provide input to the Secretariat on any specific content they think should be included in the National Action Plan. 
The Secretariat will look to circulate an early draft of the National Action Plan out of session.

A formal consultation process with a wide variety of civil society stakeholders was run from December 2015 to April 2016, including:
four information sessions in selected capital cities;
updates and posts on the OGP Australia blog;
public submissions through a wiki that the public could edit and comment;
a “co-creation” workshop with civil society stakeholders to narrow down stakeholder suggestions; and
communication through a number of channels, including social media, mailing lists, input to stakeholder newsletters, and teleconferences.
As stated in the draft Terms of Reference, it will be important for the Interim Working Group to facilitate further engagement with a broad range of stakeholders and encourage further public participation as the National Action Plan is co-drafted and finalised.
a. Timeframes
The timeframes for this last phase of consultation will be tight in order to meet the OGP’s deadline to submit the National Action Plan by 1 November 2016.
The Open Government Partnership Point of Contact Manual requires countries to make details of their public consultation process and timelines available prior to the consultation. As such, timelines for the Interim Working Group’s ongoing engagement with civil society and public stakeholders will be published on the OGP Australia blog following agreement from members:1

b. Broader consultation and public participation
Civil society members will play an important role in facilitating consultation and comment on the commitments and the draft National Action Plan through their networks. The secretariat will assist in publishing material and updates on the OGP Australia blog, through social media channels, and mailing lists.
One option for broader consultation is for the Interim Working Group to:
publish the grand challenges and the list of high priority commitments the Interim Working Group agreed to explore (as discussed at item 4); and
invite public comments until the third meeting (19 September 2016).
Future meeting agendas could also include a standing agenda item to update members on consultation and public comments received.
Ahead of the Workshop, the draft National Action Plan could also be released for public comment and circulated to government agencies (note, agencies will also be engaged through the drafting process). 
In addition, every meeting’s agenda, papers and minutes will be published on the OGP Australia blog, to encourage public participation with the co-drafting process, and to ensure that civil society plays an active and informed role in Australia’s process to join the Open Government Partnership.
For discussion and decision:

How should the Interim Working Group facilitate further consultation and encourage public participation in Australia’s OGP process? What role can civil society members play?

2. Recap from the last meeting
The co-chairs noted the Terms of Reference had been finalised and settled out-of-session. 
Members discussed the consultation approach to facilitate broader public engagement, including possible strategies to attract further public interest and potential ministerial engagement.

3. Update on consultation

Members provided an update from their respective networks, noting that there had been a good level of engagement but there is a need to provide stakeholders with more detail around commitments to encourage meaningful feedback.

Members agreed it would be desirable to publish draft commitments for public comment as they are developed , noting the drafts would be the work of the Interim Working Group and not considered or endorsed by the Government.  


4. Potential commitments for the National Action Plan
Members focused discussion around the draft commitment templates, and broadly agreed to the following potential commitments, but with some changes to further lift the ambition of the commitments and to clarify outcomes. Members nominated lead civil society members to work with the relevant agencies to update the following draft commitment templates out-of-session:

=========================================================================
﻿Potential commitments for the National Action Plan

a. Broader ambitions and goals

Civil society members have asked to explore broader ambitions/goals that could potentially be included in the National Action Plan. These broader ambitions could help frame commitments in the Plan, and also provide policy direction for the Government’s future efforts around open government. 

For example, it has been suggested that an ambition could be included around improving ethical behaviour in the corporate sector, with the potential commitments in this Plan around beneficial ownership, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and whistle‑blower protections being the first steps towards that goal. 

If the Interim Working Group (IWG) agrees, civil society members could draft possible text for further consideration out-of-session.


For discussion and agreement:

Would there be merit in including broader ambitions/goals in the National Action Plan? What types of ambitions could be considered?


b. Scope of potential commitments

At its last meeting, the IWG agreed to further discuss and explore the details of a range of potential commitments. 

Draft text will be provided to IWG members on the following potential commitments, which if there are no substantive issues, could be settled out of session:
Work towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 
Assess Australia’s compliance with the Open Contracting Data Standard.
Establish metrics to assess public utilisation of information access rights.
Improve availability and use of public data, including identifying and releasing high‑value datasets, building public data infrastructure, and enabling data-driven innovation.

Draft text will also be provided to IWG members to facilitate discussion around the following:
Improve whistle-blowers protections in the corporate sector, noting the Government’s commitment to improve protections for whistle-blowers who report tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office. 
Explore options for a beneficial ownership register for companies.
Building and maintaining public trust on data sharing.
Issues papers will be provided to IWG members to facilitate deeper discussions on the following matters:
Establish a permanent mechanism for OGP consultation during implementation of the National Action Plan.
Review and reform to information law and practice.
Enhancement of the national integrity system.

Other potential commitments the IWG has agreed to further discuss can be included on the agenda for the next meeting.


For discussion and agreement:

What are the commitments aiming to achieve and why? Is the scope and ambition appropriate? What milestones could be included? How do the commitments stack‑up against the criteria set out in the Interim Working Group’s Terms of Reference?

﻿Submission OGPIWG Attachment1
1. A national integrity system.
Election 2016 – National Integrity System
The public office, public trust principle
The demand for a national anti-corruption commission has increased over the last decade with strong public support now for the creation of such a body. The need for it is urgent; Australia’s international reputation has already been seriously damaged.
Current lack of protection for whistle-blowers in the public and private sectors means wrong-doing and corruption go unreported and whistle-blowers are vulnerable to retribution.
It is high time the Commonwealth had a comprehensive independent integrity system, incorporating a general purpose anti-corruption agency with educative, research and policy functions and all necessary powers and subject to an inspector and parliamentary oversight.

ART seeks commitments on a National Integrity System with:
A corruption control commission with powers modelled on the NSW ICAC
A code of conduct for members of each of the House of Reps and the Senate, as recommended by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
A parliamentary integrity commissioner
A cooling-off period before a former minister can accept any appointment related to former ministerial responsibilities
Full whistle-blower protection legislation for all in the public and private sector making complaints or disclosures in relation to matters within the Commonwealth arena
“A National Integrity system - Background
The Commonwealth signed the UN Convention Against Corruption, and in 2013, the Open Government Partnership. Its obligations under UNCAC Article 36 and the OGP require it to establish a National Anti-Corruption Commission. Each State now has an anti-corruption body. But risk of corruption is higher when and where money, power and influence are found, and the largest quantities of each are found at the level of the Commonwealth Government.
Notwithstanding repeated demands by many bodies such as Transparency International and the Accountability Round Table and Australia’s UNCAC and OGP obligations, no Australian anti-corruption body has been established. Instead the government created a limited specialised anti-corruption body, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), which merely establishes a framework under which the few agencies covered by it must set up corruption controls and inform the Integrity Commissioner of any information that raises a corruption issue in that agency.
ACLEI’s jurisdiction and functions are completely inadequate and inappropriate for a national anti-corruption commission. ACLEI’s levels of funding are less than half of those of the NSW ICAC alone. A principal defect of the ACLEI model is that with no single body responsible, the multi-body approach and shared responsibility results in no single body having ultimate responsibility, and vast areas of Commonwealth power are completely outside ACLEI’s remit. The consequence is a succession of scandals in the Commonwealth arena, while ACLEI was the only body supposedly in charge of investigating corruption in that area.
The risks of corruption have increased in recent years for a variety of reasons, including the:
increase in governmental control of information
ever-increasing costs of political campaigns, and the failure to provide adequate controls and transparency,
commercialisation of government services and projects
development of lobbying, the inadequacies of any attempt to control that and make it transparent in a timely manner
failure to stop or control the flow of Ministers and their staff to the lobbying industry on retirement from their positions.
 Combined with those factors there is an increased risk of corruption resulting from the impact on major commercial interests of the significant changes that will be needed to address the problems posed by climate change, and the exhaustion of natural resources. Recent events show that corporates are willing to bribe foreign governments. Why would such bodies not be prepared to act in similar fashion in Australia?
All these matters suggest that the level of commercial morality in Australia is falling at a time when authorities such as ASIC and the Australian Federal Police are failing to cope. Australia’s international reputation must be seriously damaged in these circumstances; indeed Australia’s rating has since dropped from 7th to 13th since 2012 in the International Corruption Index maintained by Transparency International. Recent developments make a further fall likely.”








2 Political Funding
Election 2016 – Political campaign finance reform
The public office, public, trust principle
Parties are like football clubs – no matter how much money they get, they will spend it and then want more.  
Former Victorian Premier, John Cain, Oct 2006
Australia’s federal electoral system has few constraints on donations and a weak disclosure regime in which thresholds were raised in 2006 from $1,500 to $10,000 and indexed by 2016 to $13,000. There are numerous loopholes and no caps on campaign expenditure. State electoral financing rules vary enormously.

ART seeks commitments on political campaign financing reform for:
Adoption of the NSW election financing measures (for the 2019 Federal election)
Caps on donations from individuals and organisations
Donations over $1,000 disclosed in continuous real time
Caps on expenditure for parties, candidates and 3rd party campaigners
Public inquiry
An independent public inquiry to identify best practice for achieving transparent, accountable and cost effective election funding longer term for all Australian jurisdictions, progressed under the OGP.
Background:
Competition between the major parties is driving up spending on election campaigns and substantial donations are made for this purpose (particularly to the major party expected to win the election) by business and organisations with vested interests in the decisions of and contracts awarded by parliaments and governments.
2013 Federal election
Labor
Coalition
Donations
$169.2m
$198.2m
Public funding
$21m
$27m
Public funding totalled $58m (plus the unknown cost to revenue forgone for tax deductions on donations up to $1,500 to parties and $1,500 to candidates).
Complete records of expenditure are not available but based on these figures, would be in the order of $450m. With 15.468m eligible voters, this is a spend of at least $29/voter. Canada, NZ and the UK have caps on election spending and this results in spends for each eligible voter of:
$5 in the 2015 Canadian election
$2.83 in the 2014 NZ election
85 pence in the 2015 UK election
 
A recent Australian survey shows 88% support for limits in election spending and 80% for lowering disclosure thresholds.
Federal and state disclosure thresholds and reporting requirement comparisons:
Federal   $13,500  annual
NSW       $1,000  annual
Vic            not required
Qld           $1,000  twice a year
WA           $2,300  annual
Tas            not required
NT             $1,500  annual
Individual donation limits and bans:
NSW:       $5,800/party  $2,500/candidate  tobacco, liquor and gambling donors banned
Federal and other states and territories:   no limits on donations or bans
NSW introduced caps on expenditure in 2011. The ACT does not cap donations but from 2015 restricts expenditure to $40k 






3. The OAIC 
The public office, public trust principle
..an open, inclusive economic system backed by open, political inclusive institutions – that is the best guarantor of success” 
David Cameron, UK Prime Minister
Information is held by government officials in public trust for the Australian people, not for the government. It is the people’s information. For a well-functioning democracy, governments must resist the temptation to abuse their power over the information entrusted to them and ensure that it is exercised in the public interest.
The OAIC plays a crucial role in ensuring the Federal government upholds the democratic principles of openness and transparency but government cuts to funding and attempts to abolish the OAIC have seriously undermined its capacity to perform this role.
ART seeks commitments on the OAIC for
Sufficient additional funding to enable the OAIC to adequately discharge its strategic, policy, complaints and review functions of FOI as well as Privacy
Appointments to each of the three statutory Commissioner positions for FOI, Privacy and Information Policy
A comprehensive, independent inquiry into the operation of the OAIC since its inception, as recommended by the Hawke review
Background

In 2010 the OAIC was established to reform the then failing FOI system. This independent body was given the power to review decisions, consider complaints and promote open government.
The 2013 Hawke inquiry found good progress but, while acknowledging the OAIC’s “financial constraints”, considered it “too early” to assess future needs. But resistance in government has persisted with recent examples of senior officials arguing for more exemptions to be provided to limit the disclosure of information.
In 2014, the Government moved to abolish the OAIC. Blocked by the Senate, it achieved de facto abolition of its FOI role by reducing its funding and transferring all its FOI functions elsewhere other than the review of government decisions refusing access to information. That was “streamlined”, by enabling reviews to be conducted by the AAT. The funds expended within the OAIC on FOI work were halved in 2014 – 15. They have not been increased since then.
Privacy became its principal function. In addition, over most of that period, an Acting Information Commissioner has been appointed on 3-month terms to perform the duties of all three statutory Commissioner positions. This has handicapped the OAIC and compromised its independence. The last appointment occurred in April.
In May, all FOI functions were officially returned by Government to the OAIC but not its capacity to perform them. Funding was not materially increased and future Budget appropriations will reduce. Staff are to be increased by only three and there is still only one Acting Commissioner.
There are also other serious ongoing consequences to be addressed:
The Government’s contravention of the fundamental constitutional principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law, and
Australia’s breaches of its obligations as a member of the Open Government Partnership.

A detailed analysis of the situation follows. 





















Office of the Australian Information Commissioner 

Issues and Facts

The OAIC – The effect of the Government 2016-7 Budget
Introduction
Over the last two years the Government failed in its attempt to have a Bill passed to abolish the OAIC. But for most of that time it achieved the de facto abolition of the OAIC’s FOI jurisdiction using its control of the Budget process. 
In May this year, the Government announced in the 2016 – 17 Budget Papers that it was not proceeding with the abolition of the OAIC and was returning the FOI functions to it.  It also stated that the OAIC would “have ongoing responsibility for privacy and FOI regulation”.  As to funding it said that the “FOI funding is provided on the basis of the streamlined approach to FOI reviews adopted by the OAIC since the 2014–15 Budget”. 
Those Budget Papers do not, however, detail: 
what the Government intended to happen in relation to the OAIC’s other major FOI responsibilities, 
whether the Budget would enable sufficient staff to be appointed to perform the FOI functions returned to it,
whether the three vacant statutory FOI Commissioner positions would be filled. 
An examination of the OAIC Annual reports, the Budget Papers relating to the OAIC and public statements, sheds light on these issues.  We look first at the nature and extent of the intended return of the OAIC’s functions.

1.  The “Return” of functions to be carried out by the OAIC – what are the functions, what was removed, and what has been returned? 
1.1 The OAIC FOI statutory functions1. What are they?
The OAIC has summarised its “three main functions” in its Annual Reports, the last being the 2014 – 15 Report, as2 follows;
“The three main functions of the OAIC are:
• Information Commissioner functions — providing strategic advice on information policy and practice in the Australian Government
• privacy functions — ensuring proper handling of personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and other legislation
• freedom of information functions — protecting the public’s right of access to documents under the FOI Act.”
It continued
“The OAIC carries out a range of activities in these three core areas, including monitoring statutory compliance, investigations, assessments, complaint handling, review of decisions, education and awareness, and providing advice to and promoting responsible information handling within government and the private sector”. 
	
The performance of these functions and activities is still the statutory responsibility of the OAIC under its Act and the Freedom of Information Act 1982.  
1.2. The statutory functions removed. 
In the May 2014 Budget, the Government began its attempt to abolish the OAIC.  In its 2014-5 Annual Report, (p 8), it reported on the functions it had performed in that financial year as follows; 
“As of 30 June 2015, the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill 2014 had not been considered by the Senate. As such, the OAIC continues to undertake the full breadth of privacy functions, and to carry out the FOI IC review function. 
Resources have been provided to the OAIC for the exercise of the FOI IC review function for 2015–16. Funding for the privacy functions has been appropriated to the OAIC for the period 2015–16. The OAIC’s budget allocation for 2015–16 does not include activities in the area of information policy.
The reality was that the OAIC FOI functions had been limited by the 2014 – 15 budget to cover 1 of the 9 activities identified above - conducting reviews of FOI decisions. That function came to be described by the OAIC and Government as “streamlined” – a reference to the practice of reviews being passed to the AAT.  
The government having now arranged the return to the OIAC of all its statutory functions, does it intend that the OAIC will address them all? Or, may it in fact intend that the OAIC does no more than process complaints and reviews?  

Other questions arise; 
What is intended to be done to ensure an adequate level of funding and staff numbers 
to enable the OAIC to discharge all its FOI functions.
What about the 3 Commissioner positions that have for some time been filled by one Acting Commissioner on three month appointments.  Is it intended to restore them?  
1.3. The functions intended by government to be performed?
There does not appear to have been a detailed public statement of the government’s intentions about the performance of the returned functions. There are, however, statements   which shed light on the intention because of what is not said. 
(a)    The OAIC: The 2016 – 17 Budget Paper 3 – “Strategic Direction Statement”
In previous years, including 2015-16, the Budget Papers relating to the OAIC have included a “Strategic Directions Statement”. 
 On each occasion, the first one listed had been
1.  “Information Commissioner functions – performing strategic functions relating to  information management in the Australian government” 
It had then been followed by the Privacy function, and then
2. “freedom of information FOI functions – protecting the public’s right of access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act)”. 4
The 2016 –17 Budget Paper Statement abandoned that practice. While listing the second and third it omitted the first one listed –, 5 “the Information Commissioner functions - performing strategic functions concerning information management in the Australian government”.   
    This Budget Paper also states: 
“…the OAIC will have ongoing responsibility for privacy and FOI regulation. Ongoing funding for these functions is provided in the 2016 – 17 Budget. FOI Funding is provided on the basis of the streamlined approach to FOI by the OAIC since the 2014 – 15 Budget. ….. In 2016 – 17 and the forward years, the OAIC will focus on its strategic goals of: 
promoting and upholding information access rights
promoting and upholding information privacy rights
 achieving organisational excellence by supporting and developing the OAIC’s people, systems and processes”
The omission of the first listed “main function” and the deliberate lack of detail in the Strategic Directions Statement suggests that the reality is that the necessary funding will not be provided 
Assuming that the main FOI functions are intended to be confined to “protecting the public’s right of access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982”, while this is very important of course and can include a range of activities, it can also be met simply by continuing with the streamlined FOI refusal reviews. 
(b). A Statement of 4 May 2016 by the Acting Information Commissioner.  
He said 
“I can confirm for you this morning that other key FOI functions will be restored to the OAIC from 1 July. So we will soon commence work on updating the FOI guidelines. We will start to handle FOI related complaints which have been handled by the Ombudsman for the last 18 months. We will take over management of the FOI statistics database and FOI reporting once our colleagues in AGD have completed the process for the 2015/16 annual report. We also have some work to do to update our website and other material to reflect these changes.
I note however that we are a much leaner version of the OAIC that existed in 2014 and so there will also be changes in how we approach these functions in this new iteration of the office. “ 6  
While this is encouraging, the words are carefully chosen. It refers to “soon” commencing work on guidelines and starting to handle FOI related complaints. This may be contrasted with the next statement that the OAIC would “take over management” of the statistics database and FOI reporting (but that will not happen for some time). He also acknowledged that The OAIC is much “leaner” than it was in 2014 and will have to approach the delivery of the functions he mentioned accordingly.   
He did not include a statement as to the appointment of people to the three Commissioner posts. If it was part of the plans for the next financial year, it would presumably have been mentioned. 
All this suggests that the funding being provided in the present financial year for the performance of the FOI responsibilities is not going to be increased to bring it back to the level that existed prior to the 2014 – 15 budget which was prepared on the basis that the O AIC would be abolished by the end of 2014.
There is further evidence relevant to that. 
2. Is it intended to provide sufficient funds to enable the OAIC to do more than conduct “streamlined” FOI reviews?

2.1. Budgeted provisions for the OAIC
(a)  The Budget provisions – past and future  
According to the Budget papers, the estimated actual Expenditure of the OAIC had declined from $14.356M in 2012–137 to $13.183 M in 2015 – 168.  While the Budget estimates for 2016-179 record estimated total expenses of $14.992 M, that figure is made up principally of a departmental appropriation of $10.622 million and retained revenues of $3.777 million. 
The Forward estimates in that budget suggest a further decline. They propose a departmental appropriation in 2017-2018 of $10.567 million, $10.597 million in 2018-19 and $9.3 million in 2019-20 with estimated actual expenditure dropping from $11.333 million in 2017 – 18 to 9.940 million in 2019 – 20.
(b) Statements of the Information Commissioner and the Attorney-General 
They recently described the funding reality for all the OAIC functions for the next 4 years as the provision of $37M - an average of $9.25 million each year.10
The above reveals an intent that there be no real increase in funding in the next financial year and a decline in the three years that follow.  We have a situation where the functions to be discharged by the OAIC are significantly increased from what they were in 2014-15 but the funding has not and is intended to decline. Sufficient funds will not be provided. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the funding available to the OAIC to discharge its FOI functions will even match the level to which it was reduced in 2014 – 15.
There is detailed information available about what occurred then.
2.2. The reduction of the share of funds for FOI Functions in 2014 – 15 
The Annual Reports of the OAIC contain relevant details of the level of that funding in 2013 – 14 (the year prior to the attempted abolition of the OAIC) and the year of the attempted abolition (2014 – 15)
(a) The 2013 – 14 Budget (page 159)11. The OAIC’s total expenditure was $13.634 million.   It was estimated that - 
35% of it was directed to its FOI functions ($4.772 million)
$42,689 was “spent on processing” FOI requests made in that year 
the total departmental appropriation was $14.995 million of which $2.278 million remained     unspent at the end of that financial year. (Appendix 1, page 162)
In the previous year, the appropriation received was $17.680 million of which $15.168 million was spent12. 
(b) The 2014 – 15 Budget, (page 138)13 During the first year of the attempted abolition, significant funding reduction occurred in relation to the FOI functions. The OAIC’s total expenditure was $13.430 million, very close to the previous year. there had, however, been significant changes to the level of expenditure for the FOI functions.    The Report stated 
         “From January 2015, in accordance with the proposed legislative change outlined previously, the OAIC’s FOI functions were reduced commensurate with resources”.  
The following estimates were made;
18% of its resources were directed towards its FOI functions ($2.417 million)
$14,158 was spent on processing FOI requests (down 67%)
the total departmental appropriation was $16.843 million of which $4.560 million     remained at the end of that financial year. (Appendix 1, page 140)
Thus, total expenditure over the year on the FOI functions, was halved as the FO I functions were transferred and expenditure on the “processing” of FOI reviews was reduced by two thirds, presumably helped by the “streamlining”.

It would appear that the bulk of the work being done by the OAIC from at least 2013-4 concerned its Privacy function. It was stated in the 2014 – 15 Report (P8) that as of 30 June 2015, the OAIC “continues to undertake the full breadth of privacy functions, and to carry out the FOI IC review function”. It was also stated that, the OAIC budget allocation for 2015 – 16 “does not include activities in the area of information policy” and that additional funding had been provided for additional Privacy functions.
Unless there is information pointing to, for example, some other plan to secure a significant increase in staff members, it appears the OAIC will not have the capacity to discharge more than the FOI functions it was able to in 2014 – 15.  
3. Past, present and future staff numbers 
What light do the records of staff numbers shed on the staff needed, and the availability of staff this year, and in the future, to pick up and work on the returned FOI functions? 
According to the Budget papers, the highest staff number, 85, occurred in the year 2012 – 13.  In the first abolition year, 2014 – 15, the number fell to 64 and in 2015 – 16 it rose to 72. In both those periods, however, the reality was that the FOI work being done concerned the review of FOI decisions and that had been streamlined.  As revealed in the Budget Papers and elsewhere, including the OAIC website, since the addition in March 2014 of the Privacy functions, there has been a profound shift of focus from the OAIC’s FOI responsibilities to its Privacy responsibilities and that is likely to continue.   
But it appears that it is proposed to increase the staff in the current financial year.  Will that enable all the FOI statutory functions to be performed?  
The Budget staff prediction for 2016–17; 3 additional staff, from 72 to 75 an increase of 1.7%. There does not appear to be a statement about their intended role.  It cannot be assumed that they would all be allocated to FOI work; for there will be competition for them between the demands of the Privacy and FOI functions. But even if all three were allocated to FOI work, how would that be enough to enable the OAIC to make a serious impression on the work it needs to do in performing all the FOI functions. And the experience appears to have been that the demand for the OAIC services has constantly grown.
If the current financial plan is maintained, it would appear inevitable that the staff needed by the OAIC to discharge both its statutory Privacy and FOI functions will not be provided. Further, assuming the proposed three staff will focus entirely on the returned FOI functions, that is likely to be ineffective in enabling the OAIC to address the returned functions.
Conclusion
Appropriately resourced and staffed, the OAIC would significantly strengthen the openness and accountability of our Commonwealth Government
The reality appears to be that if matters are left as they are
the proposed funding 
the addition of only 3 staff and 
the provision of only one Commissioner,
will prevent the OAIC discharging most, if not all, of its returned statutory functions this year and significantly limit its performance of those functions that it attempts to perform. At best, the experience of the last 2 years for our Commonwealth FOI system will continue.
There are practical limits to what can be done by “streamlining”. Its use is limited unless outsourcing is used (as had been done with the Ombudsman, the Attorney- General and the AAT since late 2014).  Only the AAT outsourcing has been mentioned as continuing.  
The information available, including the government statements, point to the processing of FOI reviews as the primary FOI function that will be carried out. The other functions are likely to receive little or no attention. 
Until significant sufficient additional funding is provided, the effective de facto abolition of the OAIC as an independent statutory FOI body created by the Parliament will continue. The FOI system will remain in its failed state and severely weaken open and accountable government. 
It also needs to be borne in mind that there have been other serious consequences flowing from the two-year de facto abolition of the FOI role of the OAIC. It has resulted in the ongoing breach of
the ethical and common-law public office public trust principle that applies to all holders of public office14and 
Australia’s commitments under the international agreement, the Open Government Partnership,15 in particular, the commitments of  
1. ‘promoting increased access to this and also the link information and disclosure about governmental activities’
2. ‘providing access to effective remedies when information or the corresponding records are improperly withheld’ and  
3. Making” concrete commitments that are ambitious and go beyond a country’s current practice” 16
There is also another serious concern – breach of the fundamental constitutional principles of the Separation of Powers and the Rule of Law17.  
Our Democracy and its guiding principles, and Australia’s reputation, are being damaged as long as this situation is allowed to continue. It is critical that it be addressed soon as is possible. 
We seek the listed commitments concerning the OAIC to ensure that these issues will be properly examined and rectified as a matter of priority in the new Parliament.

=========================================================================
Dear Mr Turnbull and cabinet,
I have just had a preliminary read of the Plan and am impressed. I am impressed because if it is
thoroughly implemented it would have vastly significant changes for the better. I am actually very
curious to know if the USA is one of the 70 countries that have joined up. I am curious because if
they have it seems to me that they have a vast amount of work to do judging by the state of their
"democracy". Mind you there are still many features of there system that leave ours well behind
such as decent penalties for those who violate of environment laws such for car emissions cheats
like VW. We don't even have laws that set a standard.
Any way there problem seems to be that the fat cats have had it so so good that the people are
looking to start a revolution that could virtually destroy the country.
In our case the situation is not significantly better. It is obvious that many of the things that you are
doing or not doing will have to change if you are going to comply with the aspirations implicit in the
document.
To my mind the most serious neglect is that Climate Change is NOT being taken seriously. I keep an
eye on what is happening here and overseas and our performance is at the "D" level. I and many
others are getting more and more impatient, no angry, that some in our government are still talking
absolute nonsense, totally ignoring the advice and comment from all people regardless of their
qualifications and instead continue to spout garbage that does not stand up to rigorous and
thoughtful criticism based on experience and knowledge.

Submission on Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan
Submission on Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan
I commend the government's initiatives for Open Government as exemplified by the Open
Government National Action Plan. It is heartening to see Australia join our nearest neighbours,
Indonesia and New Zealand, and many other countries who have already completed their first
Action Plan Cycle.
As a first Action Plan I also see it addresses the commitments of the OGP towards availability of
information about government activities, support of civic participation, highest standards of
professional integrity and access to new technologies for openness and accountability. I fully
support all fourteen commitments but will only comment on a number I feel most strongly about.
Commitments 1.1 and 1.2: (i. Transparency and accountability in business)
I support the prevention of tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud. This area is
especially problematic in a global world where multi-national companies can “manipulate their
books” to minimise the tax they pay in any one country, hence maximising the return to their
shareholders. Maximising the return to shareholders needs to be balanced with the social good of
the countries they operate in.
One area that overlaps many of the commitments concerns the ASIC Registers:
1. There are costs associated with accessing some of the information available in these
registers which discourages corporate scrutiny and transparency. In countries like New
Zealand and the United Kingdom this information is free. I believe the Corporations (Fees)
Act needs to be examined, perhaps even abolished, to minimise what parts of ASIC
information incur a fee
2. The proposal to privatise the ASIC registry completely contradicts the move towards Open
Government. The data should be held by government and not a private corporation as any
private “ownership” opens up the possibility for manipulation or corruption of the data
Commitment 2.1: ... enable data-driven innovation
I support this commitment especially including the not-for-profit sector, but do see a challenge in
quantifying what are considered high-value datasets (“one man's meat is another man's poison”).
Another thing to consider is fees charged for some datasets and the possibility of reducing or
removing those fees when the data becomes less current. As an example, I work with a not-for-
profit using weather/climate data to model potential for renewable energy. In the past they
purchased recent weather data from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) to assist with their
modelling but more recently have used free NASA datasets for the same purpose. The BOM data
has finer granularity and if was available for free it would enhance the modelling process and
perhaps extend it’s applicability to other applications and research. Perhaps the fee could be
removed once the data was less current (i.e. less useful for immediate forecasting).
I would be keen to be involved in Milestone No. 4 (Round-table discussion with the not-for-profit
sector). Over recent years “citizen science” has become increasingly important to scientific
Submission on Australias first Open Government National Action Plan
Page 1 of 2Submission on Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan
investigations. The availability of these datasets to this section of the public is also to be
encouraged.
Commitment 2.3: Digitally transform the delivery of government services
I fully support this initiative but it needs to ensure that members of the public who are not
comfortable or competent with (new) digital technologies are not disadvantaged. As people age they
are more likely to require government services (pensions, health care, ...) so it is important that they
can access these services in a more traditional manner.
Commitment 3.3: Improve the discover-ability and accessibility of government data and
information
I commend the growing availability of data on data.gov.au and look forward to how access to a
growing set of data can be simplified.
I especially support the proposed improvements for online access to the 2017 State of the
Environment report and its underlying data. Of the seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals
one of the most significant is Climate Action. Providing valid unbiased and “uninfluenced”
information on the impacts of non-conventional fossil fuels is an important message to provide.
Commitment 4.1: Confidence in the electoral system and political parties
Forty years ago I worked in IT with the TAB. We used to discuss back then how much more
convenient it would be if we could vote by entering our preferences on a marked card and feeding it
through one of the TAB mark sense readers. Election results would be available as soon as the polls
closed. It could be that easy. As an interim step the electoral office could use similar technology, or
perhaps OCR (Optical Character Recognition), to register peoples votes. The voting slip would still
be the valid record of a person’s vote and subject to scrutiny as is currently the case, however, a
preliminary result could be made available in a much shorter time frame (If you’re a political /
electoral commentator you might well be unhappy with this approach).
Exposure of donations to political parties along with lobbying activity are also important indicators
as to the influences our parliamentarians are subject to.
Over the last several decades the relationship between the parliament and the public service seems
to have diverted away from the Westminster model of an independent public service towards a more
American model where senior appointments within the public service are more political in nature.
The recent “public brawl” between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General is perhaps a
reflection of this change in the relationship. These trends make it more difficult for the public
service to give independent and impartial advice.
Commitment 5.2: Enhance public participation in government decision making
Yes.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 21 Introduction
Australia is a successful and stable democracy, with relatively low levels of corruption and a
long, proud history of open government.
In 2015, we were ranked 13 th in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index,
and 9 th in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index.
But in a rapidly changing world – transformed by the digital revolution – it is important
Australia boosts its efforts to become even more open, transparent and accountable, and
improve public engagement. This is crucial as we seek to:
•
build a better society for all Australians and be more responsive to the expectations
of the community;
• stimulate economic growth and innovation;
• foster collaboration between government, business, academia, non-government
organisations and the community; and
•
continue efforts to stamp out corruption, fraud and misconduct.
Governments worldwide are moving towards more open and transparent ways of working,
with 70 countries – including Australia – now signed up to the Open Government
Partnership.
What is the Open Government Partnership?
The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative established in 2011 that aims to
secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower
citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.
Membership requires governments to work with civil society to ‘co-create’ a National Action
Plan every two years, with independent reporting on progress. Civil society is a term used by
the Partnership to broadly refer to people and organisations outside of government,
including non government organisations, business, academia, community groups and the
public.
Importantly, the Open Government Partnership doesn’t prescribe standards that countries
should follow – rather it aims to bring governments and citizens of each country together to
define their own priorities for reform.
The Australian Government confirmed its membership of the Open Government
Partnership in November 2015.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 3This National Action Plan sets out the initial steps the Government will take to achieve the
aim of improving and building confidence in Australian institutions and democracy, and to
uphold the principles in the Open Government Declaration, including to:
•
promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the power of
new technologies to make government more effective and accountable;
•
uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve services,
manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer communities; and
•
embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward
achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own country and
in an increasingly interconnected world.
The Plan sets out an agenda for the next two years across a broad range of important areas:
• Transparency and accountability in business
• Open data and digital transformation
• Access to government information
• Integrity in the public sector
• Public participation and engagement
As our first National Action Plan, it provides a foundation to continue engaging with civil
society to identify new initiatives and strengthen our efforts over time. There is also an
opportunity going forward to work with state, territory and local governments to improve
transparency and integrity at all levels of government.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 42 Efforts to date
The Australian Government has already taken a range of steps towards improving
transparency, integrity and anti-corruption in recent years, which this National Action Plan
will build upon.
Open data and digital transformation of government services are high priorities for the
Government and considerable progress has been made in a short space of time.
•
The Public Data Policy Statement, released in December 2015, commits Australian
Government entities to release non-sensitive data as open by default. Since 2013, the
number of discoverable resources on data.gov.au has grown from approximately
500 to over 20,000.
•
The Digital Transformation Agency (formerly the Digital Transformation Office) has
been established to lead the online transformation of government services, and
provide an integrated policy and strategic capability for whole of government ICT,
ICT procurement and digital. The Digital Transformation Agency will implement
wide scale change in digital capability across government departments, benefiting
the public and other users of government services.
There have been several major initiatives to improve accountability and integrity both
within and outside of government.
•
The Government commissioned an independent review of the parliamentary
entitlements system in August 2015, and has given its in-principle support to all of
the recommendations of the review.
•
The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption reported in
December 2015. The Government has introduced legislation to improve the
governance and accountability of registered organisations (unions and employer
organisations).
Steps have been taken to make government procurement more transparent, and to
encourage innovation by making it easier for start-ups and innovative small businesses to
sell services to government.
•
The National Innovation and Science Agenda committed to establish a new Digital
Marketplace for procuring ICT products and services, and seeking innovative
solutions to policy and service delivery “challenges” through the Business Research
and Innovation Initiative.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 5•
A public ICT dashboard is being developed to improve transparency around
Government ICT performance and progress on major new investments.
The Australian Government has also been active (and in many cases a leader) in
international anti-corruption and tax avoidance / transparency efforts.
•
Australia is a key member of the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group, having led
the development of the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan and the subsequent 2015-
16 Anti-Corruption Implementation Plan. The G20 High Level Principles on Beneficial
Ownership Transparency are also a legacy item of Australia’s 2014 G20 presidency.
•
Australia was also an active participant in the UK’s international anti-corruption
summit in London in May 2016. At the meeting, the Government endorsed the
Global Declaration against Corruption and announced a range of new measures,
including joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and holding an
annual government business roundtable on corruption.
•
In December 2015, the Australian Taxation Office published the first annual Report
of Entity Tax Information, which included the Australian total income, taxable
income and tax paid of large public and private companies operating in Australia.
•
The Voluntary Tax Transparency Code, announced as part of the 2016-17 Budget, is
a set of principles and minimum standards to guide medium and large businesses
on public disclosure of tax information. Adoption of the Code is voluntary, and is
designed to encourage greater transparency within the corporate sector.
These new measures build on other actions taken over the last decade to improve access to
government information and promote transparency and integrity at the federal level:
•
Whistle-blower protections in the public sector were significantly improved by the
Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 , which commenced in January 2014.
•
Freedom of information laws were reformed in 2010, and included the introduction
of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS), which requires Australian Government
agencies to publish a broad range of information on their websites.
•
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner was established in 2010 to
promote access to government information.
•
The Archives Act 1983 was amended in 2010 to reduce the period before which
government information and Cabinet documents are released. A Digital Transition
Policy and Digital Continuity 2020 Policy have also been established, requiring
government information to be created and managed digitally.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 6•
Creative Commons licensing was adopted in 2010 to accommodate access to
government information and bring consistency to licensing arrangements.
State, territory and local governments have also undertaken a range of initiatives to
promote transparency, integrity and access to information at a sub-national level.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 73 Developing this plan
The National Action Plan has been drafted through a process of consultation and
collaboration between government, non-government organisations (including the
Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network), the public and the private
sector.
Over the past year, we undertook a number of activities to explore the breadth of Australian
views on the spectrum of open government issues.
•
Raising awareness: public meetings were held in four capital cities in late 2015 to
raise awareness of Australia’s membership of the Open Government Partnership and
the process to develop Australia’s first National Action Plan. Additional awareness
raising activities were undertaken through social media, government websites,
teleconferences and webinars, and email mailing lists.
•
Seeking ideas: a formal consultation process ran from December 2015 to April 2016
to seek suggestions on potential commitments for the National Action Plan. This
included a formal submission process, teleconferences with stakeholders, and a
workshop with over 60 participants in April 2016 to help prioritise potential
commitments for the Plan. All timeframes for consultation and submissions were
published online.
•
Drafting the National Action Plan: an Interim Working Group, comprising equal
representation of government officials and non-government members, was
established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the drafting of the
National Action Plan, building on earlier consultations.
This engagement has helped shape the National Action Plan and the open government

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 9Commitment 1.1: Improve whistle-blower
protections in the tax and corporate sectors
We will improve whistle-blower protections for people who disclose information
about tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office. We will also consult on other
reform options to strengthen and harmonise whistle-blower protections in the
corporate sector with those in the public sector.
Objective: Australia will ensure appropriate protections are in place for people who
report tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste, fraud and misconduct
within the corporate sector.
Status Quo: The prevention of tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud relies
upon appropriate protections for people who report these wrongdoings.
Australian public servants who act as whistle-blowers already have significant
protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act) . This is in
contrast to Australia's corporate whistle-blower framework, which lags
behind the PID Act. Current protections are overly narrow and make it
unnecessarily difficult for those with information to qualify for protections.
A research project into public interest whistleblowing, Whistling While They
Work 2, led by Griffith University, is currently underway and looking into
improvements across the public and private sectors.
In the 2016-17 Budget, the Government announced it would introduce
whistle-blower protections for people who disclose information about tax
misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office.
Ambition: To reduce tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud by
protecting people who report such activities.
Relevance: This commitment will advance the OGP values of public accountability and
transparency by:
•
encouraging, protecting and compensating whistle-blowers whose
information reveals artificial tax structures and misconduct;
•
reducing tax misconduct and other forms of corruption, fraud and
waste by ensuring whistle-blowers are protected from retribution; and
•
ensuring tax and corporate private sector whistle-blowers have similar
protections to public sector whistle-blowers.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 12Commitment 1.2: Beneficial Ownership
We will consult with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and the
public on a beneficial ownership register for companies.
Objective:
Australia will work to improve transparency of information on beneficial
ownership and control of companies available to competent authorities.
Status Quo:
Improving transparency around who owns and benefits from financial
arrangements is key to protecting the integrity of our financial systems and
preventing the misuse of financial entities for corruption and criminal activity.
A beneficial ownership register shows who ultimately benefits from the
activities of companies.
Australia currently has tracing powers for beneficial ownership of listed
companies and investment schemes but there is room to strengthen these
provisions.
Ambition:
To ensure that adequate, accurate and timely information on beneficial
ownership and control is available to competent authorities in Australia.
To improve regional and international cooperation on taxation, including
strengthening information sharing between tax authorities and sharing
learnings to increase the transparency of beneficial ownership information. We
will use outcomes of the work by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and
the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax
Purposes this year to help develop proposals to improve implementation of
relevant international standards on transparency, including on the availability
and exchange of companies’ beneficial ownership information.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks;
•
preventing the misuse of financial arrangements for illicit purposes
such as corruption, tax evasion and money laundering;
• protecting the integrity of the financial system; and
• increasing growth through private sector investment.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 15Commitment 1.3: Natural Resource Transparency
We will work together to enhance disclosure of company payments and government
revenues from oil, gas and mining.
Objective:
Australia will work towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) standard and continue to support the application of EITI principles
around the world.
Status Quo:
The sustainable development of natural resources (oil, gas and minerals) requires
transparent and accountable management of revenue received from these
industries, including taxes, royalties and other payments.
The EITI is a global standard to promote the open and accountable management
of natural resources. The Australian Government has been a major supporter of the
EITI, committing more than A$20 million since 2007.
Australia announced its intention to seek EITI compliance on 6 May 2016, following
a pilot to test the applicability of EITI rules and principles to Australian conditions
between 2011 and 2014. This requires us to report annually on governance and
payments in the oil, gas and mining sectors.
The oil, gas and mining industries face increasing scrutiny. Our commitment to the
EITI standard will help to build the public trust necessary for an enduring and
sustainable industry.
Ambition: To enhance transparency and accountability in the extractive industries sector.
Relevance: This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
providing timely, reliable, publicly available and independently verified
data on the extractives industries’ contribution to the Australian economy;
•
encouraging EITI adoption in resource-rich countries and support a level
playing field for Australian companies seeking to invest in those markets;
•
demonstrating Australia’s commitment to global transparency, anti-
corruption and tackling tax avoidance; consistent with current domestic
and international trends; and
•
supporting the extractive industries’ social licence to operate,
demonstrating its commitment to transparent and accountable
operations.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 17Commitment 2.1: Release high-value datasets and
enable data-driven innovation
We will work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to release high-
value public datasets and drive social and economic outcomes.
Objective:
Australia will continue to make more public data openly available and
support its use to launch commercial and non-profit ventures, conduct
research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.
Status Quo:
Public data is a valuable national resource and its use and reuse can help
grow the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy outcomes.
While significant progress has been made to advance the public data agenda
within Australia, further work needs to be done to harness the full value of
this resource. Ongoing engagement is required to identify the characteristics
of high-value datasets and discover barriers to accessing and sharing data.
The public, research, not-for-profit and private sectors can innovate with this
data in order to generate new business, develop new products and services,
and create social value.
The Government has provided some support to date, including through the
Open Data 500 Australia 1 and the DataStart initiative. 2 There is now the
opportunity to build and expand on these pilot initiatives to encourage the
use of public data for social and economic outcomes.
In the Government’s policy for Better and More Accessible Digital Services , 3
the Government committed to working with research, not-for-profit and
private sectors to identify high-value public datasets for release. This will be
supported by a public registry of significant non-sensitive datasets yet to be
published on data.gov.au. The Government is also establishing a $50 million
Smart Cities and Suburbs Program to incentivise local councils to open up
their data and collaborate with communities, local business, not-for-profits
and research institutes to create innovative solutions to urban problems. 4
The Productivity Commission is undertaking an inquiry into data availability
and use that will also identify the characteristics (and provide examples) of

To develop an open dialogue between government and non-government
sectors to identify high-value datasets and to stimulate greater use and
re-use of public data in innovative ways.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information,
technology and innovation and public participation by:
• identifying and prioritising high-value datasets for priority release;
• understanding how Australian businesses and not-for-profits are using
public data;
• stimulating use and re-use of public data in innovative ways;
• encouraging the use of public data to create social value;
• identifying, facilitating and addressing barriers impeding the sharing
of and access to data; and
•
fostering a dialogue on how public data can be made more useful.

to address concerns about data sharing
We will develop an ongoing and collaborative conversation with the community to
build public trust around data sharing and integration.
Objective:
Australia will actively engage with the community regarding how public
data is being used to provide more targeted and effective policy, service
delivery and program evaluation.
Status Quo:
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, effective policy
responses require investment in joined-up data that can provide a strong
evidence-base for policy decisions.
The New Zealand Government has invested in both a whole-of-government
Integrated Data Infrastructure and enhanced analytical capability with
positive results in terms of reduced government spending and improved
public policy outcomes in areas such as human rights, law enforcement,
health, education and justice.
While the Australian Public Service (APS) has made some progress in this
area, we need to better inform the community about the benefits of data
sharing and address public concerns, including perceived values, risks, and
attitudes towards privacy.
The Privacy Act 1988 underpins the open data agenda and helps build
public trust in data-sharing activities. The Government has introduced a Bill
to amend the Act to make it an offence to deliberately re-identify personal
information from open government data.
Data literacy across the APS is also critical. In August 2016, the Department
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet released Data Skills and Capability in the
Australian Public Service to help build skills and knowledge in publishing,
linking and sharing public data.
Ambition:
To build trust about the use of integrated data and actively respond to
community concerns about data sharing. To comply with international best
practice on open data principles and participate in global fora on data.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 22Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency and public
participation by:
•
providing greater transparency on how government is using the

•
enabling experts outside of government to inform public debate;
and

of government services
We will continue to invest in digital technologies to make government services
simpler, faster and cheaper.
Objective:
Australia will harness digital technologies to make it easier for the public to
work and interact with government.
Status Quo:
The Digital Transformation Agency is an executive agency within the Prime
Minister’s portfolio. Its mission is to lead the transformation of government
services to deliver a better experience for Australians.
Innovative use of digital technologies supports the open government agenda,
through the provision of faster, cheaper and more accessible government
services. While some progress has been made, there is an opportunity to seize
the benefits of the digital revolution to improve the way government interacts
with the public.
The Digital Transformation Agency will work with government agencies to
deliver a roadmap for the digital transformation of government services and
will use public dashboards to measure its performance, which will be
benchmarked against best practice in the private sector.
Ambition:
To use digital technologies to promote transparency and public participation
in government service delivery, engaging early and often with users
throughout, so that government services meet the needs of the people who
use them.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of technology and innovation
and transparency by:
• increasing public access to government services;
• making government services more efficient and cheaper; and
• increasing transparency around performance of government service
delivery.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 26Commitment 3.1: Information management and
access laws for the 21 st century
We will ensure our information access laws are modern and appropriate for the
digital information age.
Objective:
Australia will consider options for reforms to the framework for managing and
accessing government information, including the Freedom of Information Act
1982 (FOI Act), the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act) and, where relevant, the
Privacy Act 1988 (with primary focus on the Archives Act and FOI Act), as well
as policies and practices relating to information access and management.
Status Quo:
In 2010, the Australian Government passed reforms to the FOI Act as part of a
broader plan to improve transparency and to encourage public engagement
in decision making. The 2010 reforms also included the introduction of the
Information Publication Scheme, which requires agencies to provide a broad
range of information on their websites, and amendments to the Archives Act
to reduce the open access period for Commonwealth records from 30 to
20 years over a 10 year period.
There have since been a number of reviews recommending changes to the FOI
Act, including Dr Allan Hawke’s Review of Freedom of Information Laws and
the Belcher Red Tape Review . Among other things, the Belcher Red Tape
Review recommended the Attorney-General’s Department “begin work with
relevant entities to scope and develop a simpler and more coherent legislative
framework for managing and accessing government information during its
life-cycle in a digital environment through staged reforms, commencing with
legislation regulating archives.”
The core frameworks of Australia’s information access laws (in particular the
FOI Act and the Archives Act) have not been substantially altered since
enacted in the early 1980s, when government operated in a paper-based
environment. It is therefore appropriate to consider how access to government
information is best managed into the future within the context of digital
government.
Ambition:
To develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework for managing
and accessing government information within the context of digital
government, supported by efficient and effective policies and practices.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 28Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and

of Information
We will work with states and territories to collect and publish uniform data on public
use of freedom of information access rights in Australia.
Objective:
Australia will develop uniform metrics to better measure and improve our
understanding of the public’s use of rights under freedom of information
laws. 5
Status Quo:
The Commonwealth, states and territories already collect data and produce
statistics about applications to access government information in each
jurisdiction. For example, the Office of the Australian Information
Commissioner currently releases statistics on access requests under the
Freedom of Information Act 1982 through data.gov.au.
However, the data collected is not uniform across jurisdictions, making it
difficult to compare and analyse how freedom of information rights are used
across the country. The development of consistent metrics will assist in
building a more complete picture of freedom of information rights in
Australia and could help governments improve processing of information
access requests. Metrics could include the type of applicant, application rates
per capita, release rates, review rates and refusal rates.
Ambition:
To raise awareness about the public’s rights to access government
information under freedom of information laws and enable quantitative
analysis of data across jurisdictions. This will improve understanding of
utilisation of access rights, government processes and practices, and better
align with established international metrics including the World Justice
Project Open Government Index.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
increasing awareness of public access rights to government
information;
•
enabling comparison of freedom of information access rights across

Freedom of information is used generally to cover legislated public access right to information schemes across

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 32Commitment 3.3: Improve the discoverability and
accessibility of government data and information
We will make it easier for the public to find and use government data and
information through central portals and digital platforms.
Objective:
Australia will establish platforms and tools to improve the discoverability and
accessibility of government information and public data.
Status Quo:
The creation, preservation, management and public use of government
information is fundamental to open and transparent government. The
availability of government records and data improves public access to
information, while also driving efficient business outcomes by facilitating use
and reuse of these valuable resources.
It is not enough just to make these resources open; information and public
data must be easy to find and accessible in order for it to be useful. Some
specific examples of areas where the government is seeking to improve public
access to information include:
•
Public data: Data.gov.au is the Australian Government’s open data
platform. It has enabled the open release of over 20,000 public
resources used to grow the economy, improve service delivery and
transform policy outcomes for the nation. As the number of datasets on
data.gov.au grows, Australia’s public data infrastructure needs be
upgraded to meet the demands of data users. This includes improving
search and discovery, enhancing support for collaboration, developing a
quality framework to assist publishers, and developing more robust
publishing processes.
•
Grants: There is no central point to identify and apply for Australian
Government grant opportunities and find consolidated information
about grants awarded. The Department of Finance is building
GrantConnect, a central whole-of-government system that will forecast
and publish grant opportunities, automatically notify public users of
grant opportunities of interest, and publish information on grants
awarded.
•
Corporate and administrative reporting: Corporate and administrative
reporting information is currently located on individual agency
websites or in hard copy, making it difficult to compare and contrast
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 33documents. The Department of Finance and the Department of the
Prime Minister and Cabinet are working with the Digital Transformation
Agency to make reporting information more discoverable and
accessible through the digitisation of this information.
•
Archived records: The most significant records of the Australian
Government are held by the National Archives of Australia. To facilitate
citizens’ access to these records through digital and online channels,
the Archives will continue to lead the transition from paper to digital
information practices in Australian Government agencies, digitise paper
records of high research value and increase the number of records
available for public access.
•
Environmental information: The Department of the Environment and
Energy compiles significant data to produce its State of the
Environment report and meet its other responsibilities (such as
research into the impacts of coal and coal seam gas developments on
ground water). The Department will make the 2017 State of the
Environment report and its underlying data more accessible through
SoE Digital (an innovative and interactive online platform) and
data.gov.au. It will use data visualisation tools to help publish the results
of its coal and coal seam gas bioregional assessments.
Ambition:
To make it as easy as possible to find, access and use government information
and data.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
technology and innovation by:
•
promoting a consistent approach to information governance across
Australian Government entities;
•
increasing transparency of government decision-making and policy
development;
• enabling information and data reuse for economic and social benefits;
• protecting the rights and entitlements of Australians to access
government information;
•
increasing the accessibility, usability and discoverability of public data;
and
•
improving the quality of data.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 37Commitment 4.1: Confidence in the electoral
system and political parties
We will work with the parliament and the public to investigate the conduct of the
2016 election, use of technology in elections and the framework of donations to
political parties and other political entities.
Objective: To enhance integrity and confidence in Australia’s electoral system.
Status Quo: The Government has asked Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on
Electoral Matters (JCSEM) to investigate a range of matters relating to the
conduct of the 2016 federal election, with particular attention to:
•
the potential application of new technology to casting, scrutinising and
counting votes, and whether current authorisations requirements could
be applied to all forms of communication; and
•
donations to political parties and other political entities, including the
extent of donations being received from foreign sources and the
options available to Parliament to regulate these types of donations.
JSCEM will also be asked to look at the current donations disclosure
regime and suggest any alternative approaches.
Ambition:
To ensure that public confidence in Australia’s electoral system continues to be
strong.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of accountability,
transparency and access to information by:
•
reducing the risk of undemocratic behaviour and conduct, which leads
to the perception or reality of corrupt behaviour by politicians and
political parties; and
•
increasing public confidence in Australian democracy.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 40Commitment 4.2: National Integrity Framework
We will collaborate with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and
the public to strengthen our national anti-corruption and integrity framework.
Objective:
Australia will strengthen our ability to prevent, detect and respond to bribery
and corruption. As part of this, we will regularly review the jurisdiction and
capabilities of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
(ACLEI) and the Australian Federal Police’s Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre
to ensure they can focus on protecting Commonwealth agencies from risks of
corruption.
Status Quo:
The Government takes a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to combating
corruption, under which a range of agencies play a role in preventing,
detecting and responding to corruption. We have strong laws applying to
bribery and corruption which carry significant penalties.
ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious issues
of corruption in agencies within its jurisdiction. ACLEI’s jurisdiction focusses on
protecting environments that are most at risk of criminal compromise—
namely, border regulation and law enforcement.
The Integrity Commissioner considers the nature and scope of corruption
revealed by investigations, and reports annually on any patterns and trends in
corruption in Australian Government law enforcement and other government
agencies which have law enforcement functions. Accordingly, ACLEI collects
intelligence about corruption in support of the Integrity Commissioner's
functions.
ACLEI also aims to understand corruption and prevent it. Where the Integrity
Commissioner identifies laws of the Commonwealth or administrative
practices of government agencies that might contribute to corrupt practices
or prevent their early detection, he or she may make recommendations for
these laws or practices to be changed.
As a practitioner agency, ACLEI engages actively with other government
agencies and civil society (nationally and internationally) to collect and share
information to strengthen anti-corruption arrangements in Australia and
abroad. ACLEI’s dissemination program of Information Reports is one means
by which the Integrity Commissioner transmits timely intelligence to relevant
agencies, such as to police and other integrity agencies. ACLEI and the AFP
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 41Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre (FACC) also cross-refer information to one
another, and assist one another with corruption prevention activities.
In 2014, the Government established the FACC located in the AFP
headquarters to bring together a range of Commonwealth agencies to assess,
prioritise and respond to serious fraud and corruption matters, including across
Commonwealth services, programs and employees. The FACC draws on the
collective knowledge of agencies to provide sound contemporary advice in
relation to potential fraud threats relevant to new government funding
initiatives prior to their implementation. In April 2016, the Government
provided an additional $15 million to the FACC to enhance its capacity to
detect and investigate corruption, bribery and serious economic crime.
Between the FACC and ACLEI, there is significant coverage of fraud and
corruption across Australian Government agencies, with a particular focus on
areas of high-corruption risk.
The Government has reviewed ACLEI’s jurisdiction on a number of occasions in
the past and extended its jurisdiction where a need was demonstrated.
In May 2016, the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law
Enforcement Integrity reported on its inquiry into ACLEI’s jurisdiction. Many
public submissions have advocated extension of its coverage to the entire
public sector. The Committee recommended the Government extend ACLEI’s
jurisdiction to include the entire Department of Agriculture and Water
Resources, and examine the feasibility of including the Australian Taxation
Office within ACLEI's jurisdiction. The Government is considering the report’s
recommendations.
The Government is also exploring new responses to corruption and corporate
crime. In March 2016, the Government released a public discussion paper on a
possible deferred prosecution agreement scheme in Australia. An effective
deferred prosecution agreement scheme could help encourage companies to
self-report criminal behaviour and provide enforcement and prosecutorial
agencies with a new tool to identify and bring corporate offenders to justice.
Ambition:
To aim to improve Australia’s score on Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index.
To regularly review the jurisdiction and capabilities of ACLEI and FACC, and
extend these on an as-needs basis.
To consult closely with industry, non-government organisations and the public
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 42to ensure that our law, policies and frameworks for responding to corruption
are effective, including through holding the first government business
roundtable on corruption in 2017. We will also consult publicly on the
implementation of recommendations from the Statutory Review of the Anti-
Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and associated
Rules and Regulations.
To ensure that our laws applying to the bribery of foreign public officials
facilitate effective prosecution.
To assess whether a deferred prosecution agreement scheme would facilitate
more effective and efficient responses to bribery and corporate corruption by
encouraging companies to self-report.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and
public accountability by:
•
improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks; and
•
protecting the integrity and transparency of the execution of public
policy and management.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 44Commitment 4.3: Open Contracting
We will undertake a public review of the Australian Government’s compliance with
the Open Contracting Data Standard.
Objective:
Australia will review compliance with the Open Contracting Data
Standard and continue to support the Open Contracting Global
Principles.
Status Quo:
The Open Contracting Data Standard sets out key documents and data
that should be published at each stage of government procurement and
is seen as the international benchmark. The Standard enables disclosure
of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by
defining a common data model. It was created to support organisations
to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of
contracting data by a wide range of users.
In line with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules , Australian
Government entities are required to report all procurement contracts
with a value of $10,000 or more on AusTender. However, there has not
been a formal assessment of the extent to which current practice meets
the requirements of the Open Contracting Data Standard.
At the UK Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016, the Australian
Government stated its support of the Open Contracting Data Standard
and noted the role that the Standard could play in encouraging machine-
readable open data formats across all areas of government.
Ambition:
To enhance transparency and accountability of public money in
delivering public contracts.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information
and public accountability by demonstrating transparency and
accountability in relation to the procurement of goods and services on
behalf of the Government.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 46Commitment 5.1: Delivery of Australia’s Open
Government National Action Plan
We will ensure that Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan is a platform
for ongoing dialogue, collaboration and open government reform.
Objective:
Australia will establish a permanent dialogue mechanism with civil society,
which includes a multi-stakeholder forum. The multi-stakeholder forum will
track the implementation of commitments, ensure commitments continue to
be relevant and ambitious, inform the drafting of future National Action Plans
and raise awareness about open government in the broader community.
Status Quo:
OGP countries are required to establish a multi-stakeholder forum to consult
with the public and organisations outside of government on the
implementation of the commitments included in their National Action Plan.
Detailed guidance on establishing a multi-stakeholder forum is outlined in the
OGP’s handbook. 6
OGP countries have taken different approaches to establishing their multi-
stakeholder forum. Some models adopted in other countries include:
•
Civil society network: Coalition of non-government organisations and
individuals.
•
Single forum: Convenes government, the public and organisations
outside of government in one formally established, central committee
for co-ordination.
•
Hub-and-spoke: Network of smaller forums (broken down by sector,
thematic area or commitments etc.), which may be coordinated by a
central committee.
The Government will work in partnership with civil society to determine the
structure, role, governance and membership of the OGP multi-stakeholder
forum. This may include setting up or continuing interim structures until a
permanent forum can be established.
It is also important that Australia’s commitments remain relevant and
ambitious throughout the National Action Plan cycle. This will be achieved
through ongoing review of milestones, with updates made (as necessary) in
partnership with civil society. The Government will also work with the public to
6
See: http://www.opengovpartnership.org/node/9907
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 48identify any additional commitments that could be included in the National
Action Plan over the two year cycle.
Ambition:
To identify, develop and implement ambitious open government
commitments through ongoing partnership with civil society.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of public participation and
accountability by:
•
ensuring commitments remain relevant and ambitious throughout the
National Action Plan cycle;
•
keeping government accountable for the implementation of National
Action Plan commitments;
•
raising awareness about the Open Government Partnership and open
government matters in Australia and the region; and
•
ensuring participation by a broad and diverse range of organisations
and the public in the development of National Action Plan
commitments.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 50Commitment 5.2: Enhance public participation in
government decision making
We will work together to improve public participation in government decision
making for better policy development and service delivery outcomes.
Objective:
Australia will work towards improving public participation and engagement to
enhance policy and service delivery outcomes for Australians.
Status Quo:
Government is comprised of a diverse range of organisations, with approaches
to participation varying considerably across different departments and
agencies. High barriers to participation and piecemeal or unpredictable
approaches to consultation can lead to an inefficient and dissatisfying
experience. The current mechanisms for consultation, which are adapted from
other online processes, often do not fully meet the Government’s practical
requirements for policy and program development. In addition, current
mechanisms can be ineffective in enabling ‘co-design’.
Numerous reviews have highlighted scope for improvement in the way the
Australian Public Service engages with the public when developing policies
and programs. For example, Peter Shergold’s Learning from Failure
recommended that “the APS should promote new forms of civil participation,
including digital and deliberative democracy techniques, in order to enhance
consumer-directed care, improve customer service, encourage greater public
engagement and inform the public economy”.
There is a need to identify and disseminate information on good practices and
help peer exchange between government agencies and across different levels
of government. Digital technologies also open up new opportunities for
engagement and there are a range of innovative techniques that could be
further explored at the Commonwealth level (e.g. policy hacks, online
challenge platforms and citizen juries). In addition, there has been a lack of
investment in social media and on-line tools relevant to public participation in
government decision-making.
The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 also requires
Commonwealth entities to work cooperatively with others to achieve common
objectives, where practicable.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 51Ambition:
To design and adopt a whole-of-government framework that embeds
meaningful, open, public and multi-stakeholder participation into the business
of policy development and service delivery.
Relevance:
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency,
accountability and public participation by:
• facilitating informed public participation;
• improving policy development and service delivery;
• enhancing transparency around government decision making;
• encouraging an ongoing sharing of information and views across
interest groups that builds consensus on broad policy directions; and
•
creating more engaged private and community sectors, and public.

Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 535 Australia’s leadership internationally
This National Action Plan focuses on domestic initiatives, but Australia also plays an
important role in promoting more effective governance in the Indo-Pacific region and
beyond.
We will continue to support countries in our region to build institutions that promote
stability, inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and gender equality. We will also
maintain our support for strengthened dialogue between governments, non-government
organisations, the public and the private sector, so that they can make legitimate demands
of their governments.
Australia’s development cooperation program supports a diverse range of countries, from
highly populous Indonesia to the micro-states of the Pacific. Australia therefore tailors its
cooperation to address the varied economic, political and social factors constraining
effective governance in each country context, including through:
•
reducing opportunities for corruption by strengthening checks and balances, access
to information and complaints processes;
•
assisting partner governments to reform tax policy and administration and improve
public financial management;
•
strengthening regulatory and legal environments so that businesses have greater
certainty and predictability;
•
supporting the public and businesses to resolve disputes through formal legal
systems, alternative mechanisms or institutions that combine both;
•
promoting gender equality and enhancing women’s voice in decision-making,
leadership and peace-building; and
•
building coalitions and opportunities for discussion across government, business,
non-government organisations and the public to improve public policy and
government accountability.
Australia is committed to the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action
Agenda on Financing for Development. The National Action Plan will support the
achievement of the SDGs in Australia and globally, in particular Goal 16 on peaceful and
inclusive societies, access to justice and effective institutions. Australia strongly advocated
for this goal, which will be critical for the success of the entire 2030 Agenda.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 54Australia will also endorse the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , which commits us to
transparency, openness and accountability in our domestic and international
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As a member of the Open Government Partnership, we also note our responsibility to work
globally to fight corruption, empower citizens and enhance transparency and integrity. We
will continue to work with other countries to help achieve these goals, including through
our support for the effective implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption and
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Australia, our region and beyond.
Australia will also continue to participate actively in forums such as the G20 Anti-Corruption
Working Group and OECD Development Assistance Committee networks on governance,
conflict and fragility.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 55Appendix A: Consultation and engagement
activities
Consultation and engagement on the National Action Plan commenced in November 2015.
engage 2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to help design and lead the consultation
process up until April 2016.
A summary of the consultation and engagement activities is provided below. A more
detailed report on engagement activities is available on the OGP Australia blog
(ogpau.govspace.gov.au).
Public meetings and other awareness raising activities
•
Four public information sessions were held in November 2015 to provide an overview
of the Open Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first
National Action Plan. The sessions, held in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and
Canberra, were attended by a total of 162 people, with a further 45 people watching
the livestreams online.
•
The OGP Australia blog and an email distribution list were established to provide
public updates on progress and to inform stakeholders of engagement
opportunities.
•
The hashtag #OGPau was created to discuss the project on social media, including
through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s Twitter account.
Seeking ideas for the National Action Plan
•
A wiki (ogpau.wikispaces.com) was created to provide an interactive and
collaborative forum for stakeholders to suggest commitments that could be
included in the National Action Plan. Almost 1000 people visited the wiki between
February and May 2016, and around 200 suggestions were put forward (all available
online on the wiki and blog, including a summary).
•
On 12 April 2016, a workshop was held in Canberra to discuss and prioritise the
suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. The workshop was attended
by 63 people, with a mix of government, civil society, OGP Support Unit and other
participants.
•
14 commitment templates were drafted during the workshop, covering areas such
as open data, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protection, beneficial ownership,
public participation and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The
templates were further considered within government and informed the drafting of
the National Action Plan.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 56Government engagement
An Inter-Departmental Committee was established to ensure the interests of Australian

Government Partnership more broadly.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 57Interim Working Group
An Interim Working Group was established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform
the drafting of the National Action Plan. The Group comprised equal representation of
senior government officials and stakeholder representatives:
•
Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair): Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister
and Cabinet;
• Ms Fiona McLeod (co-chair): President-elect of the Law Council of Australia;
• Dr Stein Helgeby: Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance;
• Mr Iain Anderson: Deputy Secretary, Attorney-General’s Department;
• Mr Timothy Pilgrim: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting Australian
Information Commissioner;
• Ms Meghan Quinn: First Assistant Secretary, the Treasury;
• Ms Anne Lyons: Assistant Director-General, National Archives of Australia;
• The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the Accountability Round
Table;
• Ms Maree Adshead: CEO of Open Data Institute Queensland;
• Mr Peter Timmins: Interim Convenor of the Australian OGP Civil Society Network;
• Mr Mark Zirnsak: Director of Justice and International Mission, Synod of Victoria and
Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia; and
•
Ms Katherine Szuminska: Co-Founder and Director of the OpenAustralia Foundation.
The NSW Information Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Tydd, also sat as a non-voting
jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire to build stronger relationships
with the states on open government matters.
Australia’s National Action Plan 2016-18, Draft for Consultation | 58The group worked together to identify and explore in detail the potential commitments for
the National Action Plan, building on ideas put forward from earlier consultations. The
group also considered the text of other parts of the National Action Plan, and the approach
to broader consultation and engagement on the draft Plan. Members also facilitated
targeted consultation with their wider networks throughout the process.
In addition to regular teleconferences and email correspondence, the Group held three
face-to-face meetings in Canberra, and a workshop in Sydney, which included an hour
discussion with the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon Angus
Taylor MP.
Agenda papers, meeting minutes and the outcomes of discussions with the Group have
been posted regularly on the OGP Australia blog.

Introduction
Australia is a successful and stable democracy, with relatively low levels of corruption and a long, proud history of open government.
In 2015, we were ranked 13th in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, and 9th in The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index. 
But in a rapidly changing world – transformed by the digital revolution – it is important Australia boosts its efforts to become even more open, transparent and accountable, and improve public engagement. This is crucial as we seek to:
build a better society for all Australians and be more responsive to the expectations of the community;
stimulate economic growth and innovation;
foster collaboration between government, business, academia, non-government organisations and the community; and
continue efforts to stamp out corruption, fraud and misconduct. 
Governments worldwide are moving towards more open and transparent ways of working, with 70 countries – including Australia – now signed up to the Open Government Partnership.  
What is the Open Government Partnership?
The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative established in 2011 that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.  
Membership requires governments to work with civil society to ‘co-create’ a National Action Plan every two years, with independent reporting on progress. Civil society is a term used by the Partnership to broadly refer to people and organisations outside of government, including non government organisations, business, academia, community groups and the public.
Importantly, the Open Government Partnership doesn’t prescribe standards that countries should follow – rather it aims to bring governments and citizens of each country together to define their own priorities for reform. 
The Australian Government confirmed its membership of the Open Government Partnership in November 2015.
This National Action Plan sets out the initial steps the Government will take to achieve the aim of improving and building confidence in Australian institutions and democracy, and to uphold the principles in the Open Government Declaration, including to: 
promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the power of new technologies to make government more effective and accountable;
uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer communities; and
embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own country and in an increasingly interconnected world.
The Plan sets out an agenda for the next two years across a broad range of important areas:
Transparency and accountability in business
Open data and digital transformation 
Access to government information
Integrity in the public sector
Public participation and engagement
As our first National Action Plan, it provides a foundation to continue engaging with civil society to identify new initiatives and strengthen our efforts over time. There is also an opportunity going forward to work with state, territory and local governments to improve transparency and integrity at all levels of government. 
Efforts to date
The Australian Government has already taken a range of steps towards improving transparency, integrity and anti‑corruption in recent years, which this National Action Plan will build upon. 
Open data and digital transformation of government services are high priorities for the Government and considerable progress has been made in a short space of time. 
The Public Data Policy Statement, released in December 2015, commits Australian Government entities to release non-sensitive data as open by default. Since 2013, the number of discoverable resources on data.gov.au has grown from approximately 500 to over 20,000.
The Digital Transformation Agency (formerly the Digital Transformation Office) has been established to lead the online transformation of government services, and provide an integrated policy and strategic capability for whole of government ICT, ICT procurement and digital. The Digital Transformation Agency will implement wide scale change in digital capability across government departments, benefiting the public and other users of government services.
There have been several major initiatives to improve accountability and integrity both within and outside of government. 
The Government commissioned an independent review of the parliamentary entitlements system in August 2015, and has given its in-principle support to all of the recommendations of the review.
The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption reported in December 2015. The Government has introduced legislation to improve the governance and accountability of registered organisations (unions and employer organisations).
Steps have been taken to make government procurement more transparent, and to encourage innovation by making it easier for start-ups and innovative small businesses to sell services to government. 
The National Innovation and Science Agenda committed to establish a new Digital Marketplace for procuring ICT products and services, and seeking innovative solutions to policy and service delivery “challenges” through the Business Research and Innovation Initiative. 
A public ICT dashboard is being developed to improve transparency around Government ICT performance and progress on major new investments. 
The Australian Government has also been active (and in many cases a leader) in international anti‑corruption and tax avoidance / transparency efforts. 
Australia is a key member of the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group, having led the development of the G20 Anti‑Corruption Action Plan and the subsequent 2015-16 Anti‑Corruption Implementation Plan. The G20 High Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency are also a legacy item of Australia’s 2014 G20 presidency. 
Australia was also an active participant in the UK’s international anti-corruption summit in London in May 2016. At the meeting, the Government endorsed the Global Declaration against Corruption and announced a range of new measures, including joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and holding an annual government business roundtable on corruption.
In December 2015, the Australian Taxation Office published the first annual Report of Entity Tax Information, which included the Australian total income, taxable income and tax paid of large public and private companies operating in Australia.
The Voluntary Tax Transparency Code, announced as part of the 2016-17 Budget, is a set of principles and minimum standards to guide medium and large businesses on public disclosure of tax information. Adoption of the Code is voluntary, and is designed to encourage greater transparency within the corporate sector.
These new measures build on other actions taken over the last decade to improve access to government information and promote transparency and integrity at the federal level:
Whistle-blower protections in the public sector were significantly improved by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013, which commenced in January 2014. 
Freedom of information laws were reformed in 2010, and included the introduction of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS), which requires Australian Government agencies to publish a broad range of information on their websites. 
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner was established in 2010 to promote access to government information.
The Archives Act 1983 was amended in 2010 to reduce the period before which government information and Cabinet documents are released. A Digital Transition Policy and Digital Continuity 2020 Policy have also been established, requiring government information to be created and managed digitally. 
Creative Commons licensing was adopted in 2010 to accommodate access to government information and bring consistency to licensing arrangements. 
State, territory and local governments have also undertaken a range of initiatives to promote transparency, integrity and access to information at a sub-national level. 

Developing this plan
The National Action Plan has been drafted through a process of consultation and collaboration between government, non-government organisations (including the Australian Open Government Partnership Civil Society Network), the public and the private sector. 
Over the past year, we undertook a number of activities to explore the breadth of Australian views on the spectrum of open government issues.
Raising awareness: public meetings were held in four capital cities in late 2015 to raise awareness of Australia’s membership of the Open Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first National Action Plan. Additional awareness raising activities were undertaken through social media, government websites, teleconferences and webinars, and email mailing lists.
Seeking ideas: a formal consultation process ran from December 2015 to April 2016 to seek suggestions on potential commitments for the National Action Plan. This included a formal submission process, teleconferences with stakeholders, and a workshop with over 60 participants in April 2016 to help prioritise potential commitments for the Plan. All timeframes for consultation and submissions were published online. 
Drafting the National Action Plan: an Interim Working Group, comprising equal representation of government officials and non-government members, was established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the drafting of the National Action Plan, building on earlier consultations.
This engagement has helped shape the National Action Plan and the open government priorities for the next two years. More details about engagement activities are provided at Appendix A.



Commitments
This National Action Plan consists of an ambitious package of 14 commitments. Taken together, these actions will advance transparency, accountability, public participation and technological innovation in Australia over the next two years. 
The Government will continue to engage publicly to identify new opportunities to promote open government. New commitments may either be added to this National Action Plan, or embedded in our second National Action Plan due in 2018.

Theme 1: Transparency and accountability in business
We will enhance Australia’s strong reputation for responsible, transparent and accountable business practice.

Commitment 1.1: Improve whistle-blower protections in the tax and corporate sectors
We will improve whistle-blower protections for people who disclose information about tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office. We will also consult on other reform options to strengthen and harmonise whistle-blower protections in the corporate sector with those in the public sector.

Objective
Australia will ensure appropriate protections are in place for people who report tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste, fraud and misconduct within the corporate sector.
Status Quo
The prevention of tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud relies upon appropriate protections for people who report these wrongdoings. 
Australian public servants who act as whistle-blowers already have significant protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (PID Act). This is in contrast to Australia's corporate whistle-blower framework, which lags behind the PID Act. Current protections are overly narrow and make it unnecessarily difficult for those with information to qualify for protections. 
A research project into public interest whistleblowing, Whistling While They Work 2, led by Griffith University, is currently underway and looking into improvements across the public and private sectors. 
In the 2016-17 Budget, the Government announced it would introduce whistle‑blower protections for people who disclose information about tax misconduct to the Australian Taxation Office.
Ambition
To reduce tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste and fraud by protecting people who report such activities.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of public accountability and transparency by:
encouraging, protecting and compensating whistle-blowers whose information reveals artificial tax structures and misconduct;
reducing tax misconduct and other forms of corruption, fraud and waste by ensuring whistle-blowers are protected from retribution; and
ensuring tax and corporate private sector whistle-blowers have similar protections to public sector whistle‑blowers.

Commitment 1.2: Beneficial Ownership
We will consult with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and the public on a beneficial ownership register for companies.
Objective
Australia will work to improve transparency of information on beneficial ownership and control of companies available to competent authorities.
Status Quo
Improving transparency around who owns and benefits from financial arrangements is key to protecting the integrity of our financial systems and preventing the misuse of financial entities for corruption and criminal activity. A beneficial ownership register shows who ultimately benefits from the activities of companies. 
Australia currently has tracing powers for beneficial ownership of listed companies and investment schemes but there is room to strengthen these provisions.
Ambition
To ensure that adequate, accurate and timely information on beneficial ownership and control is available to competent authorities in Australia.
To improve regional and international cooperation on taxation, including strengthening information sharing between tax authorities and sharing learnings to increase the transparency of beneficial ownership information. We will use outcomes of the work by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes this year to help develop proposals to improve implementation of relevant international standards on transparency, including on the availability and exchange of companies’ beneficial ownership information.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public accountability by:
improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks;
preventing the misuse of financial arrangements for illicit purposes such as corruption, tax evasion and money laundering; 
protecting the integrity of the financial system; and
increasing growth through private sector investment.

Commitment 1.3: Natural Resource Transparency
We will work together to enhance disclosure of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining.
Objective
Australia will work towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard and continue to support the application of EITI principles around the world.
Status Quo
The sustainable development of natural resources (oil, gas and minerals) requires transparent and accountable management of revenue received from these industries, including taxes, royalties and other payments.  
The EITI is a global standard to promote the open and accountable management of natural resources. The Australian Government has been a major supporter of the EITI, committing more than A$20 million since 2007. 
Australia announced its intention to seek EITI compliance on 6 May 2016, following a pilot to test the applicability of EITI rules and principles to Australian conditions between 2011 and 2014. This requires us to report annually on governance and payments in the oil, gas and mining sectors. 
The oil, gas and mining industries face increasing scrutiny. Our commitment to the EITI standard will help to build the public trust necessary for an enduring and sustainable industry.
Ambition
To enhance transparency and accountability in the extractive industries sector.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public accountability by:
providing timely, reliable, publicly available and independently verified data on the extractives industries’ contribution to the Australian economy;
encouraging EITI adoption in resource-rich countries and support a level playing field for Australian companies seeking to invest in those markets; 
demonstrating Australia’s commitment to global transparency, anti-corruption and tackling tax avoidance; consistent with current domestic and international trends; and
supporting the extractive industries’ social licence to operate, demonstrating its commitment to transparent and accountable operations.

Theme 2: Open data and digital transformation
We will advance our commitments to make government data open by default and to digitally transform government services.

Commitment 2.1: Release high-value datasets and enable data driven innovation
We will work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to release high-value public datasets and drive social and economic outcomes.
Objective
Australia will continue to make more public data openly available and support its use to launch commercial and non-profit ventures, conduct research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.

Status Quo
Public data is a valuable national resource and its use and reuse can help grow the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy outcomes. 
While significant progress has been made to advance the public data agenda within Australia, further work needs to be done to harness the full value of this resource. Ongoing engagement is required to identify the characteristics of high-value datasets and discover barriers to accessing and sharing data. 
The public, research, not-for-profit and private sectors can innovate with this data in order to generate new business, develop new products and services, and create social value. 
The Government has provided some support to date, including through the Open Data 500 Australia  and the DataStart initiative.  There is now the opportunity to build and expand on these pilot initiatives to encourage the use of public data for social and economic outcomes. 
In the Government’s policy for Better and More Accessible Digital Services, the Government committed to working with research, not-for-profit and private sectors to identify high-value public datasets for release. This will be supported by a public registry of significant non sensitive datasets yet to be published on data.gov.au. The Government is also establishing a $50 million Smart Cities and Suburbs Program to incentivise local councils to open up their data and collaborate with communities, local business, not-for-profits and research institutes to create innovative solutions to urban problems. 
The Productivity Commission is undertaking an inquiry into data availability and use that will also identify the characteristics (and provide examples) of public datasets that would provide high value to the public, research and private sectors, as well as the community.


Ambition
To develop an open dialogue between government and non-government sectors to identify high-value datasets and to stimulate greater use and re‑use of public data in innovative ways.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information, technology and innovation and public participation by:
identifying and prioritising high-value datasets for priority release;
understanding how Australian businesses and not-for-profits are using public data;
stimulating use and re-use of public data in innovative ways; 
encouraging the use of public data to create social value;
identifying, facilitating and addressing barriers impeding the sharing of and access to data; and
fostering a dialogue on how public data can be made more useful.

Commitment 2.2: Build and maintain public trust to address concerns about data sharing
We will develop an ongoing and collaborative conversation with the community to build public trust around data sharing and integration.
Objective
Australia will actively engage with the community regarding how public data is being used to provide more targeted and effective policy, service delivery and program evaluation.
Status Quo
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, effective policy responses require investment in joined-up data that can provide a strong evidence-base for policy decisions.
The New Zealand Government has invested in both a whole-of-government Integrated Data Infrastructure and enhanced analytical capability with positive results in terms of reduced government spending and improved public policy outcomes in areas such as human rights, law enforcement, health, education and justice. 
While the Australian Public Service (APS) has made some progress in this area, we need to better inform the community about the benefits of data sharing and address public concerns, including perceived values, risks, and attitudes towards privacy. 
The Privacy Act 1988 underpins the open data agenda and helps build public trust in data-sharing activities. The Government has introduced a Bill to amend the Act to make it an offence to deliberately re-identify personal information from open government data. 
Data literacy across the APS is also critical. In August 2016, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet released Data Skills and Capability in the Australian Public Service to help build skills and knowledge in publishing, linking and sharing public data.
Ambition
To build trust about the use of integrated data and actively respond to community concerns about data sharing. To comply with international best practice on open data principles and participate in global fora on data.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency and public participation by:
providing greater transparency on how government is using the data it collects and protecting personal information; 
enabling the community to engage with government and raise issues of concern;
enabling experts outside of government to inform public debate; and
providing more targeted and effective policy, service delivery and program evaluation.

Commitment 2.3: Digitally transform the delivery of government services
We will continue to invest in digital technologies to make government services simpler, faster and cheaper.
Objective
Australia will harness digital technologies to make it easier for the public to work and interact with government.
Status Quo
The Digital Transformation Agency is an executive agency within the Prime Minister’s portfolio. Its mission is to lead the transformation of government services to deliver a better experience for Australians.
Innovative use of digital technologies supports the open government agenda, through the provision of faster, cheaper and more accessible government services. While some progress has been made, there is an opportunity to seize the benefits of the digital revolution to improve the way government interacts with the public. 
The Digital Transformation Agency will work with government agencies to deliver a roadmap for the digital transformation of government services and will use public dashboards to measure its performance, which will be benchmarked against best practice in the private sector.
Ambition
To use digital technologies to promote transparency and public participation in government service delivery, engaging early and often with users throughout, so that government services meet the needs of the people who use them.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of technology and innovation and transparency by:
increasing public access to government services;
making government services more efficient and cheaper; and
increasing transparency around performance of government service delivery.

Theme 3: Access to government information
We will improve and modernise the way in which the public accesses government information.

Commitment 3.1: Information management and access laws for the 21st century 
We will ensure our information access laws are modern and appropriate for the digital information age.
Objective
Australia will consider options for reforms to the framework for managing and accessing government information, including the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act), the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act) and, where relevant, the Privacy Act 1988 (with primary focus on the Archives Act and FOI Act), as well as policies and practices relating to information access and management.
Status Quo
In 2010, the Australian Government passed reforms to the FOI Act as part of a broader plan to improve transparency and to encourage public engagement in decision making. The 2010 reforms also included the introduction of the Information Publication Scheme, which requires agencies to provide a broad range of information on their websites, and amendments to the Archives Act to reduce the open access period for Commonwealth records from 30 to 20 years over a 10 year period.
There have since been a number of reviews recommending changes to the FOI Act, including Dr Allan Hawke’s Review of Freedom of Information Laws and the Belcher Red Tape Review. Among other things, the Belcher Red Tape Review recommended the Attorney-General’s Department “begin work with relevant entities to scope and develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework for managing and accessing government information during its life-cycle in a digital environment through staged reforms, commencing with legislation regulating archives.”
The core frameworks of Australia’s information access laws (in particular the FOI Act and the Archives Act) have not been substantially altered since enacted in the early 1980s, when government operated in a paper-based environment. It is therefore appropriate to consider how access to government information is best managed into the future within the context of digital government.
Ambition
To develop a simpler and more coherent legislative framework for managing and accessing government information within the context of digital government, supported by efficient and effective policies and practices.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public accountability by:
ensuring government information access laws are modern and capable of meeting the demands of the digital age; 
increasing awareness of public access rights to government information; and
improving efficiency of processing access to information requests;

Commitment 3.2: Understand the use of Freedom of Information
We will work with states and territories to collect and publish uniform data on public use of freedom of information access rights in Australia.
Freedom of information is used generally to cover legislated public access right to information schemes across all jurisdictions. For example, in New South Wales the relevant legislation is the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW).
Objective
Australia will develop uniform metrics to better measure and improve our understanding of the public’s use of rights under freedom of information laws.
Status Quo
The Commonwealth, states and territories already collect data and produce statistics about applications to access government information in each jurisdiction. For example, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner currently releases statistics on access requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 through data.gov.au. 
However, the data collected is not uniform across jurisdictions, making it difficult to compare and analyse how freedom of information rights are used across the country. The development of consistent metrics will assist in building a more complete picture of freedom of information rights in Australia and could help governments improve processing of information access requests. Metrics could include the type of applicant, application rates per capita, release rates, review rates and refusal rates.
Ambition
To raise awareness about the public’s rights to access government information under freedom of information laws and enable quantitative analysis of data across jurisdictions. This will improve understanding of utilisation of access rights, government processes and practices, and better align with established international metrics including the World Justice Project Open Government Index.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public accountability by:
increasing awareness of public access rights to government information;
enabling comparison of freedom of information access rights across jurisdictions and internationally; and
improving freedom of information access practices and efficiency of processing access to information requests.

Commitment 3.3: Improve the discoverability and accessibility of government data and information 
We will make it easier for the public to find and use government data and information through central portals and digital platforms.
Objective
Australia will establish platforms and tools to improve the discoverability and accessibility of government information and public data.
Status Quo
The creation, preservation, management and public use of government information is fundamental to open and transparent government. The availability of government records and data improves public access to information, while also driving efficient business outcomes by facilitating use and reuse of these valuable resources.
It is not enough just to make these resources open; information and public data must be easy to find and accessible in order for it to be useful. Some specific examples of areas where the government is seeking to improve public access to information include:
Public data: Data.gov.au is the Australian Government’s open data platform. It has enabled the open release of over 20,000 public resources used to grow the economy, improve service delivery and transform policy outcomes for the nation. As the number of datasets on data.gov.au grows, Australia’s public data infrastructure needs be upgraded to meet the demands of data users. This includes improving search and discovery, enhancing support for collaboration, developing a quality framework to assist publishers, and developing more robust publishing processes.
Grants: There is no central point to identify and apply for Australian Government grant opportunities and find consolidated information about grants awarded. The Department of Finance is building GrantConnect, a central whole-of-government system that will forecast and publish grant opportunities, automatically notify public users of grant opportunities of interest, and publish information on grants awarded.
Corporate and administrative reporting: Corporate and administrative reporting information is currently located on individual agency websites or in hard copy, making it difficult to compare and contrast documents. The Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet are working with the Digital Transformation Agency to make reporting information more discoverable and accessible through the digitisation of this information.
Archived records: The most significant records of the Australian Government are held by the National Archives of Australia. To facilitate citizens’ access to these records through digital and online channels, the Archives will continue to lead the transition from paper to digital information practices in Australian Government agencies, digitise paper records of high research value and increase the number of records available for public access. 
Environmental information: The Department of the Environment and Energy compiles significant data to produce its State of the Environment report and meet its other responsibilities (such as research into the impacts of coal and coal seam gas developments on ground water). The Department will make the 2017 State of the Environment report and its underlying data more accessible through SoE Digital (an innovative and interactive online platform) and data.gov.au. It will use data visualisation tools to help publish the results of its coal and coal seam gas bioregional assessments.
Ambition
To make it as easy as possible to find, access and use government information and data.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and technology and innovation by:
promoting a consistent approach to information governance across Australian Government entities;
increasing transparency of government decision-making and policy development;
enabling information and data reuse for economic and social benefits;
protecting the rights and entitlements of Australians to access government information; 
increasing the accessibility, usability and discoverability of public data; and
improving the quality of data.

Theme 4: Integrity in the public sector
We will improve transparency and integrity in public sector activities to build public confidence and trust in government.

Commitment 4.1: Confidence in the electoral system and political parties
We will work with the parliament and the public to investigate the conduct of the 2016 election, use of technology in elections and the framework of donations to political parties and other political entities.
Objective
To enhance integrity and confidence in Australia’s electoral system.
Status Quo
The Government has asked Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JCSEM) to investigate a range of matters relating to the conduct of the 2016 federal election, with particular attention to:
the potential application of new technology to casting, scrutinising and counting votes, and whether current authorisations requirements could be applied to all forms of communication; and
donations to political parties and other political entities, including the extent of donations being received from foreign sources and the options available to Parliament to regulate these types of donations. JSCEM will also be asked to look at the current donations disclosure regime and suggest any alternative approaches.
Ambition
To ensure that public confidence in Australia’s electoral system continues to be strong.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of accountability, transparency and access to information by:
reducing the risk of undemocratic behaviour and conduct, which leads to the perception or reality of corrupt behaviour by politicians and political parties; and
increasing public confidence in Australian democracy.

Commitment 4.2: National Integrity Framework
We will collaborate with the corporate sector, non-government organisations and the public to strengthen our national anti-corruption and integrity framework.
Objective
Australia will strengthen our ability to prevent, detect and respond to bribery and corruption. As part of this, we will regularly review the jurisdiction and capabilities of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) and the Australian Federal Police’s Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre to ensure they can focus on protecting Commonwealth agencies from risks of corruption.
Status Quo
The Government takes a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to combating corruption, under which a range of agencies play a role in preventing, detecting and responding to corruption. We have strong laws applying to bribery and corruption which carry significant penalties.
ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious issues of corruption in agencies within its jurisdiction. ACLEI’s jurisdiction focusses on protecting environments that are most at risk of criminal compromise—namely, border regulation and law enforcement.
The Integrity Commissioner considers the nature and scope of corruption revealed by investigations, and reports annually on any patterns and trends in corruption in Australian Government law enforcement and other government agencies which have law enforcement functions. Accordingly, ACLEI collects intelligence about corruption in support of the Integrity Commissioner's functions.
ACLEI also aims to understand corruption and prevent it. Where the Integrity Commissioner identifies laws of the Commonwealth or administrative practices of government agencies that might contribute to corrupt practices or prevent their early detection, he or she may make recommendations for these laws or practices to be changed.
As a practitioner agency, ACLEI engages actively with other government agencies and civil society (nationally and internationally) to collect and share information to strengthen anti-corruption arrangements in Australia and abroad. ACLEI’s dissemination program of Information Reports is one means by which the Integrity Commissioner transmits timely intelligence to relevant agencies, such as to police and other integrity agencies. ACLEI and the AFP Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre (FACC) also cross-refer information to one another, and assist one another with corruption prevention activities.
In 2014, the Government established the FACC located in the AFP headquarters to bring together a range of Commonwealth agencies to assess, prioritise and respond to serious fraud and corruption matters, including across Commonwealth services, programs and employees. The FACC draws on the collective knowledge of agencies to provide sound contemporary advice in relation to potential fraud threats relevant to new government funding initiatives prior to their implementation. In April 2016, the Government provided an additional $15 million to the FACC to enhance its capacity to detect and investigate corruption, bribery and serious economic crime.
Between the FACC and ACLEI, there is significant coverage of fraud and corruption across Australian Government agencies, with a particular focus on areas of high-corruption risk. 
The Government has reviewed ACLEI’s jurisdiction on a number of occasions in the past and extended its jurisdiction where a need was demonstrated. 
In May 2016, the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity reported on its inquiry into ACLEI’s jurisdiction. Many public submissions have advocated extension of its coverage to the entire public sector. The Committee recommended the Government extend ACLEI’s jurisdiction to include the entire Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, and examine the feasibility of including the Australian Taxation Office within ACLEI's jurisdiction. The Government is considering the report’s recommendations.
The Government is also exploring new responses to corruption and corporate crime. In March 2016, the Government released a public discussion paper on a possible deferred prosecution agreement scheme in Australia. An effective deferred prosecution agreement scheme could help encourage companies to self-report criminal behaviour and provide enforcement and prosecutorial agencies with a new tool to identify and bring corporate offenders to justice.
Ambition
To aim to improve Australia’s score on Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. 
To regularly review the jurisdiction and capabilities of ACLEI and FACC, and extend these on an as-needs basis. 
To consult closely with industry, non-government organisations and the public to ensure that our law, policies and frameworks for responding to corruption are effective, including through holding the first government business roundtable on corruption in 2017. We will also consult publicly on the implementation of recommendations from the Statutory Review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and associated Rules and Regulations.
To ensure that our laws applying to the bribery of foreign public officials facilitate effective prosecution. 
To assess whether a deferred prosecution agreement scheme would facilitate more effective and efficient responses to bribery and corporate corruption by encouraging companies to self-report.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public accountability by:
improving the effectiveness of our legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks; and
protecting the integrity and transparency of the execution of public policy and management.

Commitment 4.3: Open Contracting
We will undertake a public review of the Australian Government’s compliance with the Open Contracting Data Standard.
Objective
Australia will review compliance with the Open Contracting Data Standard and continue to support the Open Contracting Global Principles.
Status Quo
The Open Contracting Data Standard sets out key documents and data that should be published at each stage of government procurement and is seen as the international benchmark. The Standard enables disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It was created to support organisations to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.
In line with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, Australian Government entities are required to report all procurement contracts with a value of $10,000 or more on AusTender. However, there has not been a formal assessment of the extent to which current practice meets the requirements of the Open Contracting Data Standard.
At the UK Anti-Corruption Summit in May 2016, the Australian Government stated its support of the Open Contracting Data Standard and noted the role that the Standard could play in encouraging machine-readable open data formats across all areas of government.
Ambition
To enhance transparency and accountability of public money in delivering public contracts.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of access to information and public accountability by demonstrating transparency and accountability in relation to the procurement of goods and services on behalf of the Government.

Theme 5: Public participation and engagement
We will improve the way the Australian Government consults and engages with the Australian public.

Commitment 5.1: Delivery of Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan 
We will ensure that Australia’s Open Government National Action Plan is a platform for ongoing dialogue, collaboration and open government reform.
Objective
Australia will establish a permanent dialogue mechanism with civil society, which includes a multi stakeholder forum. The multi-stakeholder forum will track the implementation of commitments, ensure commitments continue to be relevant and ambitious, inform the drafting of future National Action Plans and raise awareness about open government in the broader community.
Status Quo
OGP countries are required to establish a multi-stakeholder forum to consult with the public and organisations outside of government on the implementation of the commitments included in their National Action Plan. Detailed guidance on establishing a multi-stakeholder forum is outlined in the OGP’s handbook. 
OGP countries have taken different approaches to establishing their multi-stakeholder forum. Some models adopted in other countries include:
Civil society network: Coalition of non-government organisations and individuals.
Single forum: Convenes government, the public and organisations outside of government in one formally established, central committee for co-ordination.
Hub-and-spoke: Network of smaller forums (broken down by sector, thematic area or commitments etc.), which may be coordinated by a central committee.
The Government will work in partnership with civil society to determine the structure, role, governance and membership of the OGP multi stakeholder forum. This may include setting up or continuing interim structures until a permanent forum can be established.
It is also important that Australia’s commitments remain relevant and ambitious throughout the National Action Plan cycle. This will be achieved through ongoing review of milestones, with updates made (as necessary) in partnership with civil society. The Government will also work with the public to identify any additional commitments that could be included in the National Action Plan over the two year cycle.


Ambition
To identify, develop and implement ambitious open government commitments through ongoing partnership with civil society.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of public participation and accountability by:
ensuring commitments remain relevant and ambitious throughout the National Action Plan cycle;
keeping government accountable for the implementation of National Action Plan commitments; 
raising awareness about the Open Government Partnership and open government matters in Australia and the region; and
ensuring participation by a broad and diverse range of organisations and the public in the development of National Action Plan commitments;

Commitment 5.2: Enhance public participation in government decision making 
We will work together to improve public participation in government decision making for better policy development and service delivery outcomes.
Objective
Australia will work towards improving public participation and engagement to enhance policy and service delivery outcomes for Australians.
Status Quo
Government is comprised of a diverse range of organisations, with approaches to participation varying considerably across different departments and agencies. High barriers to participation and piecemeal or unpredictable approaches to consultation can lead to an inefficient and dissatisfying experience. The current mechanisms for consultation, which are adapted from other online processes, often do not fully meet the Government’s practical requirements for policy and program development.  In addition, current mechanisms can be ineffective in enabling ‘co-design’.
Numerous reviews have highlighted scope for improvement in the way the Australian Public Service engages with the public when developing policies and programs. For example, Peter Shergold’s Learning from Failure recommended that “the APS should promote new forms of civil participation, including digital and deliberative democracy techniques, in order to enhance consumer-directed care, improve customer service, encourage greater public engagement and inform the public economy”.
There is a need to identify and disseminate information on good practices and help peer exchange between government agencies and across different levels of government. Digital technologies also open up new opportunities for engagement and there are a range of innovative techniques that could be further explored at the Commonwealth level (e.g. policy hacks, online challenge platforms and citizen juries). In addition, there has been a lack of investment in social media and on-line tools relevant to public participation in government decision-making.
The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 also requires Commonwealth entities to work cooperatively with others to achieve common objectives, where practicable.


Ambition
To design and adopt a whole-of-government framework that embeds meaningful, open, public and multi-stakeholder participation into the business of policy development and service delivery.
Relevance
This commitment will advance the OGP values of transparency, accountability and public participation by:
facilitating informed public participation;
improving policy development and service delivery;
enhancing transparency around government decision making; 
encouraging an ongoing sharing of information and views across interest groups that builds consensus on broad policy directions; and 
creating more engaged private and community sectors, and public;

Australia’s leadership internationally
This National Action Plan focuses on domestic initiatives, but Australia also plays an important role in promoting more effective governance in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.
We will continue to support countries in our region to build institutions that promote stability, inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and gender equality. We will also maintain our support for strengthened dialogue between governments, non-government organisations, the public and the private sector, so that they can make legitimate demands of their governments.
Australia’s development cooperation program supports a diverse range of countries, from highly populous Indonesia to the micro-states of the Pacific. Australia therefore tailors its cooperation to address the varied economic, political and social factors constraining effective governance in each country context, including through:
reducing opportunities for corruption by strengthening checks and balances, access to information and complaints processes;
assisting partner governments to reform tax policy and administration and improve public financial management;
strengthening regulatory and legal environments so that businesses have greater certainty and predictability;
supporting the public and businesses to resolve disputes through formal legal systems, alternative mechanisms or institutions that combine both;
promoting gender equality and enhancing women’s voice in decision-making, leadership and peace-building; and
building coalitions and opportunities for discussion across government, business, non-government organisations and the public to improve public policy and government accountability.
Australia is committed to the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. The National Action Plan will support the achievement of the SDGs in Australia and globally, in particular Goal 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and effective institutions. Australia strongly advocated for this goal, which will be critical for the success of the entire 2030 Agenda. 
Australia will also endorse the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which commits us to transparency, openness and accountability in our domestic and international implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  
As a member of the Open Government Partnership, we also note our responsibility to work globally to fight corruption, empower citizens and enhance transparency and integrity. We will continue to work with other countries to help achieve these goals, including through our support for the effective implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Australia, our region and beyond. Australia will also continue to participate actively in forums such as the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group and OECD Development Assistance Committee networks on governance, conflict and fragility.

Appendix A: Consultation and engagement activities
Consultation and engagement on the National Action Plan commenced in November 2015. engage 2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to help design and lead the consultation process up until April 2016.
A summary of the consultation and engagement activities is provided below. A more detailed report on engagement activities is available on the OGP Australia blog (ogpau.govspace.gov.au). 
Public meetings and other awareness raising activities
Four public information sessions were held in November 2015 to provide an overview of the Open Government Partnership and the process to develop Australia’s first National Action Plan. The sessions, held in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, were attended by a total of 162 people, with a further 45 people watching the livestreams online.
The OGP Australia blog and an email distribution list were established to provide public updates on progress and to inform stakeholders of engagement opportunities. 
The hashtag #OGPau was created to discuss the project on social media, including through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s Twitter account.
Seeking ideas for the National Action Plan
A wiki (ogpau.wikispaces.com) was created to provide an interactive and collaborative forum for stakeholders to suggest commitments that could be included in the National Action Plan. Almost 1000 people visited the wiki between February and May 2016, and around 200 suggestions were put forward (all available online on the wiki and blog, including a summary).
On 12 April 2016, a workshop was held in Canberra to discuss and prioritise the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. The workshop was attended by 63 people, with a mix of government, civil society, OGP Support Unit and other participants. 
14 commitment templates were drafted during the workshop, covering areas such as open data, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protection, beneficial ownership, public participation and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The templates were further considered within government and informed the drafting of the National Action Plan. 
Government engagement
An Inter-Departmental Committee was established to ensure the interests of Australian Government agencies were considered in the development of the National Action Plan. This Committee was chaired by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet with participation from high level officials from the following agencies:
Attorney-General’s Department
Australian Bureau of Statistics
Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
Australian Electoral Commission
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
Australian Public Service Commission
Department of Agriculture and Water Resources
Department of Communications and the Arts
Department of Defence
Department of Education and Training
Department of Employment
Department of the Environment and Energy
Department of Finance
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
Department of Health
Department of Human Services
Department of Immigration and Border Protection
Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
Department of Social Services
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
The Treasury
Department of Veterans’ Affairs
Digital Transformation Agency
National Archives of Australia
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner
The Committee met four times and also considered material out-of-session, including the suggested commitments put forward by stakeholders. Government ministers were also briefed on commitments that fall within their area of responsibility and on the Open Government Partnership more broadly.
Interim Working Group
An Interim Working Group was established in August 2016 to provide input and help inform the drafting of the National Action Plan. The Group comprised equal representation of senior government officials and stakeholder representatives:
Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair): Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet;
Ms Fiona McLeod (co-chair): President-elect of the Law Council of Australia;
Dr Stein Helgeby: Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance;
Mr Iain Anderson: Deputy Secretary, Attorney-General’s Department;
Mr Timothy Pilgrim: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting Australian Information Commissioner;
Ms Meghan Quinn: First Assistant Secretary, the Treasury;
Ms Anne Lyons: Assistant Director-General, National Archives of Australia;
The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill: Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the Accountability Round Table;
Ms Maree Adshead: CEO of Open Data Institute Queensland;
Mr Peter Timmins: Interim Convenor of the Australian OGP Civil Society Network;
Mr Mark Zirnsak: Director of Justice and International Mission, Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia; and
Ms Katherine Szuminska: Co-Founder and Director of the OpenAustralia Foundation.
The NSW Information Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Tydd, also sat as a non-voting jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire to build stronger relationships with the states on open government matters.
The group worked together to identify and explore in detail the potential commitments for the National Action Plan, building on ideas put forward from earlier consultations. The group also considered the text of other parts of the National Action Plan, and the approach to broader consultation and engagement on the draft Plan. Members also facilitated targeted consultation with their wider networks throughout the process.
In addition to regular teleconferences and email correspondence, the Group held three face-to-face meetings in Canberra, and a workshop in Sydney, which included an hour discussion with the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon Angus Taylor MP.
Agenda papers, meeting minutes and the outcomes of discussions with the Group have been posted regularly on the OGP Australia blog.

Public submission
8 November 2016
Open Government Partnership: Draft National Action Plan - Public Submissions
Sociometry is a privately-held consultancy specialising in community consultation and participative
social impact assessment. Our staff have considerable experience in working in the extractives sector
in Australia and internationally, and on civic infrastructure projects and strategic community
development program planning in remote Australia. Clients are governments or project/program
proponents seeking to establish what might be called a social license to operate. I am its co-owner
and managing director.
Given my limited familiarity with earlier phases of this consultation and the extremely short period
allowed for this phase of consultation, I restrict comments to Theme 5. Should business priorities
allow, I may make a subsequent submission.
I give permission for this submission to be made public.
Theme V: Public participation and engagement
The draft plan is well structured and easy to read.
It could be improved by insertion of an expansion to the subsection “Status Quo” to include reference
to relevant international leading practice to provide better context. This comment may equally apply
to all sections of the draft plan.
The draft could be improved by a sharper presentation of key challenges in the Status Quo section.
A strong articulation of one or two key problems may provide an anchor for subsequent work during
consultation and allow a more focused evaluation program to be developed.
I would urge focused and early consultation on the stakeholder participation approach for plan
implementation. Aside from Theme 5, there are specific references to consultation among the
commitments. It is not clear that where consultation is not specifically mentioned if the Australian
Government intends to consult on detailed design of implementation actions and well as
accountability/reporting. Overall, the nature of the envisaged partnership is not apparent. This is not
trivial given the section “Development the Plan” is ambiguous.
 Commitment 5.1
The proposal to establish a permanent forum for dialogue with civil society is commendable.
Together with the phrase “partnership with civil society” suggest decision-making by consensus
and/or existence of a veto on the part of “civil society”. It seems to me the remit of this forum is
absolutely core to the purpose and credibility of the international initiative.
ABN 98 147 078 277It is reasonable to consult with civil society to develop the forum mechanisms. However, the draft
should not proceed further without resolving the question of the institutional decision-maker and
the decision-making process. So as not to mislead CSO that “partnership” means joint decision-
making, the degree of delegation from the minister should be made apparent very early in the piece
– not when proposals arise in detailed implementation. It would be appropriate to have a high-level
terms of reference attached to the plan to guide the early work of the lead government agency and
civil society groups that may wish to be involved.
 Commitment 5.2
The draft should be amended to clarify that a “whole-of-government” framework to improve public
participation in government decision making is not intended to include both state/territory and local
governments in addition to Commonwealth agencies. I understand there is a global pilot project for
sub-national governments, but the draft national action plan should consider explicit links through
COAG processes to alignment of revised frameworks. This is particularly important where
Commonwealth and state/territory agencies share decision-making responsibility such as some
environmental approvals.
With respect to ambition, we should really be challenging ourselves to a higher level of performance.
There is already framework in(s) place but experienced public participation professionals working at
the coalface will often testify that a greater barrier is capacity within government. Consider a quality
management system: having a policy and guidance is not sufficient without the other elements of a
coherent management systems. This commitment should be expanded to address a suite of elements
including: policy; objectives/targets; risk assessments; resources, roles and responsibilities;
competency, training and assessment; documentation and control; performance incident
investigation; corrective and preventative actions; audit and review.
Consider the very explicit procedural rules in place under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse
Gas Storage (Environmental) Regulations, the specific guidance available and the latest review of
legislation and regulation by the Dept of Industry, Innovation and Science. Despite fairly prescriptive
consultation requirements, a significant group of stakeholders continue to be frustrated by the
inconsistent practices of petroleum titleholders and the NOPSEMA (the independent regulation of
safety and environment matters for offshore petroleum industry). It is the ability of organisations to
evaluate successes and failures and adapt their practices that will lead to improved decision-making
and such organisation learning requires system level change. Guidance and tools are useful but
improvements in consistent, predictable and transparent public participation require culture change
that can be underpinned by quality management systems.
Commitment 2.1 illustrates the need to develop capacity and the challenge of designing citizen
engagement in the full glare of public policy development. Ahead of Commitment 5.2 being put in
place, a consultation process appears to have been designed for 2.1 and it is not clear how the
planning process that has been used would measure against the expectations set out in the IAP2
Quality Assurance Standards.
The need for additional deliberative capacity - particularly data analysis - seems to be recognised by
reference to the New Zealand capacity-building experience during its OGP journey and the draft’s
commitment to, “Engage with the community and improve privacy risk management capability
across government to build public trust around data sharing and integration”. The United States has
developed capacity in the specific area of applying behaviour science to obtain value from ‘big data’through the Social and Behavioural Science Team (www.sbst.gov) and the work of this group may be
a model that can be adapted for Australia.
 Additional commitment: transparency in decision-making
I propose a commitment 5.3 that would require development through consultation of a Policy Impact
Statement, Program Impact Statement, or Project Impact Statement for major Commonwealth
undertakings. Similar to the familiar Regulatory Impact Statements but more robustly based on (open
data) evidence, such participative modelling of the expected effects would focus public input and
provides an established procedural toolset. Consultation without the focus of such systematic ex-
ante impact assessment can be unfocused. Policy and cost-benefit analysis without consultation can
result in blind spots and later public angst. Consultation is not impact assessment.
The Draft seems to recognise such an issue at Commitment 1.3 with a commitment around “providing
timely, reliable, publicly available and independently verified data on the extractives industries’
contribution to the Australian economy”. This may or may not include reinforcing guidelines on
accounting for opportunity cost in modelling contribution of extractives to the economy and prevent
the worst cases of misleading information going unchallenged to the detriment of government policy,
regulatory and management decisions.
 Costs
The high-level allocation of costs and benefits from consultation that improves decision quality from
more open government should be a concern of the national action plan. An explicit pricing formula
for funding access to data and making that data more open, should also be within the remit of the
plan and seems indicated at Theme 2 (“...work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors
to release high-value datasets and drive social and economic outcome...”). It is not clear (privacy
considerations notwithstanding) if this new national resource will be given away for free, if ‘open
data’ means it is provided at cost, and when (like mineral resources) it will attract royalties or super-
profits / rent tax.
Kind regards,

Appendix A: Sub-categories of themes – summary of input received
This document is a summary of engagement undertaken between November 2015 and
19 May 2016 for the development of Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan.
It summarises the channels used for engagement, how stakeholders used these channels
during the engagement period and the key themes of input received during engagement. It
also outlines lessons learned by engage2 during the process, and our recommendation to
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) for ongoing engagement with
stakeholders during the delivery and implementation of the National Action Plan.
The strategy to engage stakeholders during the development of the National Action Plan
was published as a draft in February 2016 as an extension of the consultation plan outlined
by PM&C in November 2015. Updates made during the project and the original consultation
plans are all available on the OGPAU website: https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/contribute/

Purpose of engagement
To encourage collaboration among stakeholders across Australia, working with them to
develop suggested actions to be included in the Open Government National Action Plan.
Three stages of engagement:
There were five stages of the project, the first three involved engagement (see image 2).
1.
Stage 1: Preparation, framework and history (November – December 2015).
To inform stakeholders and encourage their input into the design of consultation
and input into the background and context sections of the document
2.
Stage 2: Raise awareness, gather suggestions (January – March 2016)
To promote the project and encourage stakeholders to suggest potential actions for
consideration in the National Action Plan.
3.
Stage 3: Prioritisation and drafting workshop (April – May 2016)
To encourage discussion about, and prioritisation of, suggested actions and
co-create templates for potential commitments for Ministers and Cabinet to consider
in Stage 4.
4. Stage 4: Consideration of the National Action Plan by the Australian Government.
5. Stage 5: Launch of the National Action Plan.
At the time of writing, stages 4 and 5 had been delayed by the timing of the Federal election,
and the associated caretaker conventions.
Please refer to the strategy document for more information about the stages, objectives for
each stage and channels used for engagement: https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/contribute/

Image 2: Stages of engagementApproach to engagement
Engagement was designed to encourage participation from anyone. It was not a deliberative
or representative process, but we did our best to reach stakeholders across Australia.
engage2 sought to raise awareness of the project and suggested actions, as well as
promote opportunities to participate.
Our approach was: open; transparent; accessible; responsive; efficient for stakeholders and
government; and we intentionally set out to build stakeholder capabilities to engage in the
process.
The project team was named publicly and all communications were signed off with their
direct contact details; stakeholders could easily contact the project team at any time to get
support and have their questions answered. Multiple channels were used to make it easy for
people to participate at varying degrees of engagement. Weekly updates were provided
about engagement and teleconferences took place as open discussions with questions
answered in real time; records of teleconferences were uploaded to the wiki for those
interested who could not attend.
engage2 identified ‘primary stakeholders’ including state government Open Government
teams, Local Government Associations, related professional associations and convenors of
Open Government networks. engage2 engaged with them directly at the start of the process
so they could engage their networks early on. engage2 also attended industry events and
provided newsletter content, and ‘Introduction to Open Government’ and ‘How to Suggest an
Action’ tips and templates content for stakeholders to share with their networks.
Degrees of engagement
We accommodated three levels of engagement in the process. Participants could:
 Stay informed – by registering for updates
 Get involved – by suggesting an action on the wiki, commenting on updates on the
blog; participating in OGP events (teleconferences and co-creation workshop);
making a submission
 Collaborate – join an OGP working group; host an event; participate in the
co-creation workshop
These levels are presented in image 2, and image 3 outlines how many stakeholders
engaged at various levels.
Engagement was promoted through:
 Information sessions run by PM&C during November and December in 4 locations
across Australia. The hashtag #ogpau was created and one of these sessions was
videocast so participants who could not attend physical locations could join the
discussion.
 16 updates were sent about the project by email and uploaded to the blog.
The channels set up for engagement included:
 OGPAU Website and blog: http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au
 OGPAU Wiki – share an idea, comment on others: http://ogpau.wikispaces.com
 Email to PM&C at ogp@pmc.gov.au and to engage2 at Amelia@engage2.com.au
 Phone inquiries directly to Amelia Loye (engage2) at 0411950585
Page 5 of 34 | Teleconferences using join.me
 Co-creation workshop in Canberra on 12 th April
 Interested stakeholders could request participation from the project team at their
events through an online form
 The hashtag #ogpau was created to discuss the project on social media
 Participants could also join the OGP working groups – these were promoted during
Stage 2 of the project to encourage stakeholders to suggest an action

 The stakeholder list now includes 430 stakeholders, a 34% increase since 1 February
2016. 84 of these stakeholders have consented to ongoing engagement to date –
see image 11 below. A survey has been set up to gain permission to share contact
details.
Image 11: Consent to share contact details
Page 15 of 34 |Request for ongoing engagement
During the co-creation workshop and since the event in April, several stakeholders have
expressed their views about ongoing engagement. They have requested that an interim
multi-stakeholder group be set up to enable greater partnership among senior government
officials and non-government representatives to engage more of civil society, business and
other organisations. They would like this group to report to the Prime Minister to showcase
and further develop the draft National Action Plan. After being trialled, they would like to see
this interim arrangement established as a formal mechanism for ongoing OGP engagement.
They have requested government cover the expenses of members of the interim committee.
Page 16 of 34 |Lessons learned
What worked well

Working with, not for, PM&C meant that engage2 could:
o relate to, and build personal relationships with, stakeholders which
helped to increase trust;
o be open and transparent about the engagement process and answer
questions from our perspective not as representatives of government;
o be proactive at sharing information and project updates without having to
go through editing and approval processes;
o be responsive and accessible to stakeholders when they had questions;
o support stakeholders to provide input into formats that made it easier for
government to consider and respond to; and
o encourage engagement and collaboration among them when they had
related ideas; which meant collaborative relationships were developed
and ideas were refined before the co-creation workshop.
 The teleconferences had several advantages:
o stakeholders could participate from home or their office, appreciated
Amelia answering questions in real time and in front of others, and
enjoyed talking to each other;
o they were informal interactions that gave stakeholders recognition for
their investment into the process and helped them build relationships
with each other before the workshop which supported ongoing open
government delivery;
o having a clear agenda, structure and facilitation helped keep discussion
on track and ensured everyone who participated had significant time for
introductions and questions; and
o using video worked particularly well – even if only available to some
stakeholders.
 Online comments required logging in which ensured stakeholders were credited
for their investment and input, and also increased accountability of those
commenting online.
 Providing a name and direct contact details demonstrated openness and provided a
personal touch which stakeholders appreciated. Initially it was thought this would
result in more contact from stakeholders and possible spamming, but it actually had
the opposite effect. Being available demonstrated transparency and openness, and
meant stakeholder questions were answered quickly in a personal fashion that
stakeholders appreciated.
 This personalised support also meant that Amelia was able to build good
working relationships with motivated and passionate stakeholders making both
online and offline engagement, and issues management more effective. For
example, through:
Page 17 of 34 |o knowing stakeholders and their interests meant Amelia could
acknowledge and respond to them directly which helped with
moderation;
o by the time stakeholders arrived at the co-creation workshop they knew
Amelia and she was able to acknowledge their investment, passions and
input, facilitate the dynamics in the room and increase the level of
collaboration and co-creation;
o identifying passionate and motivated stakeholders; making sure they were
engaged early, that their interests were understood, personally inviting them
to have a role in the process and letting them know they can talk openly at
any time; and
o being transparent with stakeholders about how their input would be used and
offering them support to shape it into useful formats for Government
consideration. Connecting them to other stakeholders with similar interests so
they can discuss ideas and work together on suggested actions.
 Tracking and reporting input as frequently as possible to both PM&C and the public
helped stakeholders understand each other’s interests and build on each other’s
ideas. Publishing comments on the wiki encouraged stakeholders to engage with
each other and also helped government understand what stakeholders were
interested in so they could discuss the input internally and prepare an official
response.
Opportunities for improvement
 A longer lead-time for engagement would have helped to expand the reach of
engagement. It was hard to get the attention of the NGO and business sectors. Many
had never heard of the Open Government Partnership and communicating the
opportunity took time. As stakeholders started to understand the opportunity they
were more likely to engage and promote engagement among their networks.
 Increased promotion of the project through media and social media would have
helped to increase awareness of the project and may have expanded the reach of
engagement.
 Leveraging soft media like industry newsletters and events was very effective.
Promoting newsletter content and encouraging greater involvement of the project
team in events would have helped increase reach and depth of engagement.
 Stakeholders wanted to see more ownership of the project from PM&C and greater
transparency around the way the political arm of government was engaging in the
process.
 Greater clarity around the challenges and a statement about issues that were not
being addressed through this process was required to manage expectations and
would have helped to redirect attention / tension around those topics away from the
project.
 To deliver on all the actions suggested, Government would also need to nominate an
organisation that could manage and respond to actions suggested for Parliamentary
openness and reform. Having an organisation like this involved would have:
o emphasised the separation of powers between the Parliament and
bureaucracy
Page 18 of 34 |o helped to demonstrate accountability at that level of Government, and
removed the pressure off the project team to manage inquiries about issues
outside their remit
o helped to educate stakeholders about role (and limitations) of the bureaucracy
in open government making the scope of influence clearer.
 To the point above, it would have been useful at the start of the process for the Open
Government Partnership Support Unit to provide greater clarity to both the public and
the project team about how these types of issues are usually addressed in action
plans among other partners.
 The teleconferences worked well – they were responsive to stakeholders needs and
project dynamics - but it may have been better to:
o have a combination of planned and responsive teleconferences throughout
the process. Scheduling teleconferences, particularly later in the process,
would have enabled stakeholder interested in meeting each other and
participating in person, to organise local events where they could participate
as a group; and
o have a mix of sessions for just stakeholders, and a mix with government
representatives. For example, scheduling a regular session with
representatives at the beginning and end of a teleconference, then allowing
time for open discussion amongst civil society during the middle of the
teleconference agenda may have helped to increase the transparency of the
internal processes and may have helped to build relationships between
stakeholders with government.
 Tracking and reporting input frequently to government and the public could have
been done better by providing input from both the blog and wiki page in a format that
was easier for both government and stakeholders to consider and respond to.
 Select digital tools and integrate technology used for engagement that makes it
easier to track issues, analyse and report data collected through engagement. This
process was manual, which was slow, making it hard to show real time summaries of
issues and reducing the time available to engage with stakeholders. This would have
also helped with the point above.
 Social media listening did not work on this project largely due to the limited promotion
of content about the project. Promoting more content would have allowed us visibility
of who shared it and built upon it. Understanding this may have helped to identify
stakeholders, influencers and networks for engagement around the project and
ongoing open government actions across Australia.
 The response to Local Government Associations’ engagement was mixed. It is
recommended that PM&C engage with these groups more formally to introduce Open
Government Partnership and invite their involvement in engaging Local Government
Associations.
 An email informing stakeholders about caretaker mode and its impact on the project
would have helped to ‘close the loop’ with stakeholders engaged.
 Engage with representatives from government and civil society from Tasmania and
Northern Territory. If representatives are not present, identify potential organisations
or individuals likely to be interested and help build capacity in the region.
Page 19 of 34 | Hold co-creation workshops in multiple major cities to allow individuals unable to fund
themselves to travel to Canberra to participate.
 Increased engagement with Indigenous and Torres Strait communities and
organisation to allow for improved representation in the process.
Page 20 of 34 |Recommendations
1. Publish this report
It is recommended that this report be made public to demonstrate transparency and to
support the Independent Reporting Mechanism.
2. Update stakeholders and ‘close the loop’
Closing the loop of engagement is about wrapping up the current stage of the project,
thanking stakeholders for their investment into the process, acknowledging input and
advising them about the outcome of the project or next stage of the process.
To close the loop with stakeholders engaged through this process, it is recommended that:
i.
ii.
An email update be sent to all stakeholders to:
o Thank them for their time, their input and the actions suggested and their
support to get the National Action Plan to this stage of development.
o Inform them about the status of the plans and how they can stay updated
about the project (and the delivery of action).
o Request consent for the ongoing use and sharing of their contact details from
those who have not already provided it.
o Link to this engagement report published on the project or engage2 website.
o Invite ongoing contact and/or participation in ongoing engagement for OGP
engagement - or to inform them about when to expect an update about the
formal ongoing engagement mechanism.
o Acknowledge progress on Open Government in Australia more generally.
Release a detailed outline of how input received to date has been considered and
addressed as a compliment to this engagement report. This should include a
summary of how each commitment template prepared at the co-creation workshop
has been responded to.
3. Consultation to finalise the National Action Plan
Given that the finalisation of Australia’s National Action Plan has been held up by the
election, it is recommended that after the election PM&C continue to engage stakeholders in
the development of the National Action Plan. This engagement should include:
i.
Consultation on the draft National Action Plan – enabling comments or asking
questions at specific sections of the document, including each potential
commitment;
OR
ii.
Consultation on the commitment templates drafted at the co-creation workshop with
specific questions asked to indicate the Government’s position about them and
request further input for consideration.
This process will need to clarify which commitments are on the table for further consideration
in the National Action Plan and which ones are not. It is highly recommended that clear
responses also be provided to actions proposed / drafted commitment templates that will not
Page 21 of 34 |be addressed through the current National Action Plan. This may also include a second
engagement process, as outlined below.
This process should also seek to reach stakeholders not well represented in the process
including:
 Not for profit sector
 Indigenous representatives
If any new commitments are proposed in the draft to be launched for consultation, it is
recommended that stakeholders who have provided input to date on related topics and those
who may be impacted be engaged directly prior to the launch.
This engagement should include a mix of online and face-to-face engagement, and should
get beyond the capital cities. It is recommended that government agencies that will lead
drafted commitments nominate a key representative for this engagement and that they are
briefed about input to date and relationships built so the investment made by stakeholders is
recognised and partnerships for delivery can be established.
4. A separate engagement process about Parliamentary Openness
It is understood that some countries in the OGP have developed a separate Plan for
Parliamentary openness and reform. Based on this information and input collected
throughout this engagement, it is recommended that the Australian Government consider
running a second engagement process so actions that cannot be delivered by government
agencies can be considered.
An authority that could accept responsibility to deliver these kinds of actions would need to
be nominated to manage this engagement process.
This would help the Government complete the current action plan, emphasise the separation
of powers and demonstrate a willingness of the Government to consider development of a
second National Action Plan that addresses Parliamentary openness specifically.
5. Ongoing engagement for the National Action Plan OGP
The formal mechanism
The OGP requires that a formal mechanism be created for ongoing engagement. In the
co-creation workshop it was proposed that PM&C recommend that a commitment to this
formal mechanism be included in Australia’s National Action Plan.
It is recommended that this formal mechanism be:

Populated through an expression of interest that is widely promoted with clear
criteria for the group. As a starting point, this criteria might include:
Page 22 of 34 |
o representativeness – demographic, across sectors, discursive and regional
representation should be sought
o some experience using Open Data, engaging stakeholders or engaging with
government
o representatives from other levels of government
o regional open government champions
o access to variety of networks / industries / communitieso
representatives who are experienced at reaching Culturally Linguistically
Diverse Communities and people from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds
 funded but not managed by government
 appointed and managed by an independent body and that a secretariat be provided
to support the management of this group including:
o coordination and facilitation of meetings
o publishing of meeting outputs
o opportunities for other stakeholders to provide feedback on outputs of the
formal mechanism and input into their discussions
o engagement with the OGP Support Unit and working groups
Several stakeholders formed a group, called the Australian Open Government Partnership
Network (AOGPN), early in the engagement process. It is recommended that their members
be invited to express their interest in participating in the formal mechanism but that this
organisation does not become the formal mechanism.
The stakeholders in this group are highly experienced in Open Government and highly
effective advocates. The insight into Open Government they have shown throughout this
process and their willingness to drive Open Government in Australia has been invaluable.
Their ongoing engagement will be critical to the success of the OGP in Australia. It should
be noted that their membership is not representative of the spectrum of topics covered by
Open Government, and several stakeholders throughout the engagement process
expressed a discomfort with joining the group because they felt their approach was geared
to lobbying ~ advocacy as opposed to collaboration.
To meet the proposed criteria for a formal mechanism outlined above, this group should
adjust the way they engage with other stakeholders outside of their core team. They would
also require a secretariat and ongoing funding to be sustainable and deliver the
transparency and engagement required by a formal ongoing engagement mechanism.
Amelia has made these suggestions to four members of the AOGPN Steering Committee
directly.
Delivery of the actions proposed
Each of the commitment templates name a lead agency and partners to support the delivery
of proposed commitments and actions. It is recommended that the agencies nominated to
lead these actions engage with these stakeholders to acknowledge input, enlist support, and
demonstrate transparency and the desire to work with stakeholders as soon as possible.
To support this engagement it is recommended that PM&C:
 Brief lead agencies about specific stakeholders engaged throughout the OGP
process whose input relates to their commitments and whose involvement would
help to support their delivery of actions proposed. Then request consent from
stakeholders to share their contact details with agencies.
 Share contact details of those who have provided consent at the co-creation
workshop as soon as possible
State government engagement
Some of the commitments proposed require the implementation of standards and the
coordination of activities across levels of government. Our engagement with the state and
Page 23 of 34 |government Open Government teams was very well received. Several states have
significant teams and initiatives and were keen for further leadership and engagement from
PM&C about Open Government. Contacts from these engagements have now been shared.
It is highly recommended that PM&C send a formal letter to all state government Open
Government contacts inviting their input into the National Action Plan before requesting their
involvement in the delivery of specific actions.
Local government engagement
engage2 hoped to be able to work with Local Government Associations (LGAs). The
response to our engagement with Local Government Associations was mixed. It is
recommended that PM&C engage with these groups more formally perhaps before the draft
National Action Plan is released, then invite their support for implementation and promotion
of Open Government in LGAs more widely.
6. Informal engagement with and among stakeholders
To demonstrate it’s commitment to Open Government it is recommended that PM&C show
leadership and support for others delivering Open Government across Australia by:


Creating a unique online environment that enables:
o public reporting of progress against commitments and milestones outlined in
the National Action Plan
o promotion of opportunities to engage / have input / use data etc.
o stakeholders to engage and collaborate with each other, even forming online
communities of practice around topic areas if there is interest
o stakeholders to offer and request support for open government initiatives
o stakeholders to upload case studies
o the formal mechanism to engage with stakeholders and invite their input into
their processes; including meeting agendas, materials they develop and their
suggestions to Government
o opportunities to engage stakeholders in the self-assessment process or
throughout National Action Plan cycles
o methods to inform stakeholders about engagement for future National Action
Plan development
o the sharing of materials from the OGP and others around the world that are
supporting Government and stakeholders to deliver Open Government. For
example the Open Private Sector platform from the World Bank.
o links to the OGP website and databases of actions from other countries
o anyone to request involvement in events to talk about the OGP and Open
Government more generally
Creating a suite of materials about the OGP and Australia’s National Action Plan
that can be downloaded and shared by stakeholders with their networks. This might
include a presentation deck, input for newsletters, discussion points for events /
workshops, guidance for other levels of Government. It is highly recommended that
these materials also include some materials about Open Government actions and
benefits to specific industries and sectors e.g. how open data is being used for
Page 24 of 34 |collaborative impact and social outcomes in indigenous communities, the open
company’s initiatives and benefits and examples of how a transparency initiative is
affecting/potentially benefitting extractive industries.
 Run high profile open events mid-term with Open Government champions and
influencers from around the country and the world, for example the Open State
events being run in South Australia in October this year.
 Publishing and sharing contact details of stakeholders with others consent is
provided.
 Create a social media channel for the OGPAU project – it is an ongoing project that
requires updates and engagement.
 Ensure these activities are well resourced for ongoing content creation, community
management and engagement.
This type of approach will make self-assessment and engagement to develop future National
Action Plans easier for government. It will enable government to:
1. demonstrate openness, transparency and accountability of Government initiatives
2. keep stakeholders updated which will help to maintain trust
3. maintain up-to-date contact details of stakeholders, and skills and relationships that
can be leveraged for open government initiatives
4. stay across Open Government activities going on across Australia.
5. inform self-assessments and leverage stakeholder input into them
6. ensure understanding of stakeholders perception of Government initiatives and
interests so they do not come as a surprise through the independent review – this
will also help inform initiatives and priorities
7. build relationships among civil society and Government in preparation for the
co-creation of development of the next National Action Plan
7. Australia’s attendance at the OGP Summit
It is recommended that the Australian Government consider attending the OGP Summit to
be held in Paris in December 2016 to demonstrate its commitment to the Open Government
Partnership, build relationships with contact points in other countries and gain a deeper
understanding of commitments and processes.
8. Start engagement for the second National Action Plan earlier
Prepare now.

1. Arrival and welcome
Ms McLeod noted the key sessions for the day were to:
Discuss any changes to commitments following feedback from within government.
Discuss other components of the National Action Plan.
Engage with Assistant Minister Taylor. 
Discuss the approach to public consultation on the draft National Action Plan and key communication and awareness raising activities.

2. National Action Plan
PM&C provided an overview of the process within government to finalise the draft National Action Plan for public consultation. 

Members discussed the ultimate authorship of the Plan. Members agreed that as the Plan is in the process of being considered by the Government and is subject to change, the language should reflect that the Plan has been developed by the Australian Government, and informed by the work of the Interim Working Group. 

PM&C confirmed that comments received during the public consultation process would inform the Government’s final consideration of the Plan.

a. Feedback from within government and discussion of proposed commitments.
PM&C provided feedback from within government on several of the proposed commitments. Members discussed potential changes to the commitments and PM&C agreed to make updates where possible, noting that more substantive changes may need to be considered through the upcoming consultation process.
Mr Newman emphasised the opportunity to leverage research currently being undertaken by Griffith University on whistle-blower protections.
Dr Coghill reiterated his preference for the Plan to commit to an inquiry into the funding and expenditure of political parties eligible to receive public funds.
Mr Zirnsak raised the possibility of the Plan including consultation on the implementation of recommendations from the statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006.
Ms Adshead led a discussion on the importance of defining the characteristics of ‘high-value’ datasets.
Civil society members emphasised their desire for ongoing responsibility for the Open Government Partnership and for any future whole-of-government work on improving public participation to be led by PM&C. 
Action: PM&C to make updates to commitments where possible.
b. Foreword and other content for the National Action Plan.
PM&C sought feedback from the Group on draft content for the following components of the National Action Plan:
Introduction; 
Efforts to date;
Developing this plan; and
Australia’s leadership internationally.
Members suggested changes to each of the components and for PM&C to consider.
Civil society members raised the need to include a broad vision statement in the Introduction, which would outline the longer term objectives of Australia’s membership of the Open Government Partnership.
Civil society members also emphasised their desire for a separate international commitment in the Plan, noting opportunities for Australia to host an Asia-Pacific regional meeting of the Open Government Partnership, and to leverage Australia’s regional aid and development programs to achieve open government outcomes. 
Action: PM&C to make updates to the other components of the National Action Plan.
3. Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus Taylor MP
Assistant Minister Taylor made opening remarks, noting the importance of the open government agenda, and his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open data agenda and digital transformation of government. 
The Assistant Minister also noted that openness and transparency are key tools to achieving better outcomes for all Australians and are also an important economic issue.
Ms McLeod noted the broad spectrum of open government issues and the need for aspirational goals. Civil society members highlighted key issues for Australia’s first National Action Plan:

Mr Zirnsak raised the opportunities of improving transparency and accountability in the business and corporate sectors to drive social and economic outcomes across Australia, including through measures such as improved corporate whistle-blower laws, a beneficial ownership register, and improving Australia’s compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Ms Adshead led discussions on open data and digital transformation noting the opportunities for open data to facilitate not only private sector innovation but also public sector innovation. Members also discussed the need to build data skills and capability at all levels of government.
Mr Timmins raised the importance of reviewing and reforming information access laws and practice to ensure they are appropriate for the 21st century and the digital information age.
Ms Szuminska led discussions on improving public participation and engagement within government.
Dr Coghill led discussions on enhancing the national integrity system, and improving confidence in the electoral system and political parties.

Civil society members also urged Assistant Minister Taylor to support strong Australian representation at the OGP Global Summit in Paris.

4. Morning Wrap-Up
5. Public consultation
a. Timeframes
PM&C provided an update on timeframes and next steps, including the proposed timeframes for government approval processes. PM&C noted that the Plan would be released for a minimum of two weeks for public consultation. 

b. Consideration of submissions
Members discussed the proposed public consultation and submission process, including timeframes, methods of submission and the scope of public consultation. 
Members agreed the most useful feedback would be on the details of commitments in the Plan. Members agreed that it would be difficult to incorporate ideas for new commitments at this late stage of the development of the Plan, and noted that a formal consultation process had been conducted in December 2015-April 2016 to seek ideas for commitments in the Plan.
Civil society members noted the challenge to ensure wide consultation in the consultation timeframes.
c. Communication and awareness raising 
Members held a brainstorming session on communication activities that could be undertaken in the lead up to and during the period of public consultation on the draft National Action Plan.
Some proposed ideas to raise awareness of the public consultation included:
Utilise Australian Government agencies’ contact lists to ensure relevant stakeholders are engaged on specific commitments.
Undertake a whole-of-government approach to promotion and communications (including through multiple agency websites and social media), but channelling submissions back through a central process (managed by PM&C).
Ministerial media releases to target mainstream media, and also encourage further ministerial engagement.
Develop stakeholder kits (including, for example, social media messages) to assist stakeholders with communications.
Leverage existing events and public meetings.
Civil society members and PM&C to work together to organise information sessions in selected locations around Australia.
Teleconferences with state, territory and local governments.
Members agreed for PM&C to develop a coordinated communication and awareness raising strategy. 
Action: PM&C to draft a communication and awareness raising strategy and circulate to the Group for input.
6. Other business
a. OGP Global Summit – Paris, December 2016
PM&C provided information on the process to attend the OGP Global Summit, noting that the management of civil society invitations rested with the OGP Support Unit. Members were encouraged to register their interest in attending by the deadline of 31 October 2016.
Mr Timmins noted that financial support from the Australian Government could assist civil society representatives with attending the summit.
b. Australian representation on OGP Working Groups
PM&C provided information on the six thematic working groups that are open to all governments and civil society organisations involved in the OGP. PM&C provided information on any Australian representatives on the working groups, and noted that the process to join was to contact 
co-anchors of the groups.

=========================================================================
﻿Have your say on Australia’s first 
Open Government National Action Plan 
The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever Open Government National Action Plan for public consultation. This is the final round of consultation in a year‑long process to develop the National Action Plan.
The National Action Plan sets out an ambitious agenda for the next two years, focused on: transparency and accountability in business; open data and digital transformation; access to government information; integrity in the public sector; and public participation and engagement. 
The creation of a National Action Plan is part of the commitment the Australian Government made when it became a member of the Open Government Partnership. 
What is the Open Government Partnership?
The Open Government Partnership is an international initiative established in 2011 that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. There are 70 participating countries. More information can be found at www.opengovpartnership.org.
What action is the Government proposing to take?
This is Australia’s first National Action Plan. It sets out the initial actions the Government will take to uphold the principles of open government, improve and build confidence in Australian institutions, and strengthen our democracy. A package of 14 commitments has been proposed across five themes, as set out on the following page.
How was the Plan developed? 
Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft Plan through a variety of consultation activities which started in November 2015. An Interim Working Group of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders was also established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the commitments. 
What is the Government seeking feedback on and how do I provide feedback?
The focus of this round of consultation is on the details of the proposed commitments in the Plan (e.g. Are there potential implementation issues? Is the level of ambition appropriate?) Consultation was undertaken earlier in 2016 to seek ideas on potential commitments for the Plan.
The draft Plan and further information on its development (including details of the Interim Working Group) is available online at www.ogpau.govspace.gov.au. Public submissions close at 5pm AEDT on 18 November 2016, and can be made by emailing ogp@pmc.gov.au. Submissions will be published.
What happens next? 
The Open Government Partnership sets deadlines for submitting National Action Plans. The Government will consider public comments and potential changes to the Plan, before submitting it before the end of 2016. There will be ongoing engagement with the public throughout implementation, and on the development of future National Action Plans.
National Action Plan commitments 
Theme I: Transparency and accountability in business
Improve whistle-blower protections in the tax and corporate sectors.
Consult on the details, scope and implementation of a register of beneficial ownership of companies.
Work towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to enhance disclosure of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining.
Theme II: Open data and digital transformation
Work with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to release high-value datasets and drive social and economic outcomes.
Engage with the community and improve privacy risk management capability across government to build public trust around data sharing and integration.
Deliver a whole-of-government digital transformation roadmap and a live dashboard measuring the performance of government services.
Theme III: Access to government information
Consider options for reforms to the framework for managing and accessing government information (including the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Archives Act 1983 and, where relevant, the Privacy Act 1988) to deliver a simpler and more coherent framework within the context of digital government.
Improve understanding of the public’s use of freedom of information by working with the states and territories to collect and publish uniform data.
Improve the discoverability and accessibility of government data and information through central portals and digital platforms.
Theme IV: Integrity in the public sector
Work with the parliament and the public to investigate the conduct of the 2016 election, use of technology in elections and the framework of donations to political parties and other political entities.
Strengthen our national anti-corruption and integrity framework, including regularly reviewing the jurisdiction and capabilities of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and the Australian Federal Police’s Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre.
Undertake a public review of the Australian Government’s compliance with the Open Contracting Data Standard.
Theme V: Public participation and engagement
Establish a permanent forum for dialogue with civil society to monitor implementation of the National Action Plan and inform the drafting of future National Action Plans.
Develop a whole-of-government framework to improve public participation in government decision making for better policy development and service delivery.

Public Data Branch
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
PO Box 6500
Canberra ACT 2600
31 October 2016
Dear Public Data Branch,
I provide the below submission as feedback on the draft Open Government National Action Plan.
I authorise its publication online.
Yours sincerely,
Justin Warren
Managing Director
PivotNine Pty LtdComments on the Draft Open Government National Action Plan
These comments relate to the consultation draft of the Open Government National Action Plan published
online at http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/have-your-say-on-australias-first-open-government-national-action-
plan/.
Commitment 1.1
Commitment 1.1 states as its objective: Australia will ensure appropriate protections are in place for people who
report tax evasion or avoidance, corruption, waste, fraud and misconduct within the corporate sector.
This broad objective is not reflected in the milestones listed in the Plan for this commitment. Instead, these
commitments appear to entirely focus on the area of tax. Corruption, waste, fraud, and misconduct may relate
to many areas of corporate operations not related to tax. To focus entirely on tax would appear to leave the
majority of potential wrongdoing uncovered by any changes to legislation.
Whistle-blower protections should extend to those covering any form of corporate wrongdoing, not merely
those relating to tax.
Commitment 1.2
A beneficial ownership registry already exists in the form of ASIC’s corporate database. This database should be
publicly available and searchable, free of charge.
Instead, the government appears to be attempting to privatise this public resource
(https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/privatising-asic-database-not-a-done-deal-
coalition-says) which is in direct opposition to this commitment.
Privatising this monopoly asset, and to simultaneously be looking at recreating a new registry of the same kind
of information seems astonishingly wasteful. The search fees of $52.2 million per year (as per the above linked
article) seems tiny in comparison to other forms of government spending, such as on a national non-binding
plebiscite.
Further, the ambition stated in this commitment does not appear to align with the public accountability
aspect of the Relevance stated for this commitment. It appears focused on making this information available to
“competent authorities” instead, when surely this information is already available to competent authorities? If it
is not, how are those authorities able to fulfil their functions today?
Commitment 1.3
It is not clear to me why disclosure of company payments and government revenues should be limited to the
extractive industries. Surely if this is a good idea then it should relate to all industries equally?
What is particularly special about extractive industries that it requires a special commitment for transparency
and accountability? Is there a particular issue with transparency and accountability in this industry today?
Commitment 2.2
This commitment entirely ignores the privacy impacts of data collection and data sharing.
The assertion that “effective policy responses require investment in joined-up data that can provide a strong evidence-
base for policy decisions” is made without–somewhat ironically–evidence that existing evidence bases are used for
policy decisions. More data does not magically make for better analysis, nor does evidence based on a larger
dataset inevitably lead to better policy. Policy makers are already free to ignore research data when creating
policy today, and frequently do.The negative impacts of increased data collection and integration are far too often hand-waved away in the
pursuit of nebulous benefits. The benefits to individuals of maintaining privacy in an era of continuous
monitoring are seemingly never evaluated.
The posture of this commitment is in stark contrast to that of other commitments to transparency from
corporations and governments. Why is it that individuals are expected to provide near unlimited information
to government, often legally compelled or required to receive services,while corporations and government itself
is able to justify continued privacy and secrecy from the public?
Shouldn’t government prioritise transparency of powerful organisations over invading individual privacy?
Where is the commitment to maintaining individual privacy? Where is the commitment to obtaining
individual consent for the use of my personal, private information?
The Bill to amend the Privacy Act 1988 recently introduced by the government is atrociously bad law. If an
amendment must be made, how about making it an offence to release a dataset that enables personal
information to be re-identified?
What about introducing a penalty for disclosing information that should have been kept private? What about
providing a mechanism for individuals whose private information is disclosed without authorisation to receive
financial compensation from the government entity that breached their trust? What about, quite frankly,
placing the burden of keeping information safe on those who insist on collecting this information?
The posture of government, and other entities quite frankly, should be to not collect information they cannot
immediately justify a need for. Other people’s personal information should be a liability, not just an asset, and
the incentive structures should be configured to encourage collectors to keep this information safe.
Commitment 2.3
This commitment appears to largely relate to providing the barest of minimums of IT project and procurement
information to the public. This is hardly ambitious, as this information should already exist.
Putting a programme manager’s Red-Amber-Green dashboard on a website is trivial, and as someone who has
seen more than their fair share of these dashboards, provides little to no actual insight into what’s actually going
on.
This focus on ‘digital transformation’ as an unalloyed good thing is perplexing. Automating a bad process with
a computer doesn’t make it better.
Commitment 3.1
This commitment is vague. It appears to concentrate on creating options for a model of a framework. What
even is that? A plan to maybe come up with an option for a plan, one day, perhaps?
This commitment should instead provide more concrete milestones.
Any amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) should consider:
• ensuring that oversight functions are adequately funded as part of the legislation. Existing
arrangements can be undermined by governments opposed to transparency by de-funding the offices
charged with oversight.
• entities who abuse the FOI Act by being overly restrictive in their redactions or demands for
processing payments should suffer sanctions.
Information that should have been published already should not require an FOI processing charge to be made
available, and entities that require one should be penalised and the charges refunded in full, plus a percentage
for wasting the requester’s time.Entities that are found to have redacted information from documents released under the FOI Act for which
there was no good reason to redact it should be penalised.
The posture of government is currently too much in favour of individual data being fair game for collection and
disclosure while government itself is frequently secretive and obstructionist.
Commitment 3.2
While I applaud the general principles here, I urge caution when designing the metrics to be measured. What
gets measured gets managed, and this can lead to perverse incentives.
When designing the metrics, take the time to consider how a perverse or obstructionist actor may choose to
interpret them. For example, frequently useful information should not actually require a request under the FOI
Act for it to be published, it should simply be readily available. However, a change to greater transparency may
see a drop in the number of FOI requests. Is that good, or bad?
Commitment 3.3
I am curious about the use of the term ‘public data’. It appears to refer to datasets collected and managed by the
government, but this is misleading. The information in many of these datasets is supplied by individuals. Data
supplied by me in the course of accessing government services is still mine, it is not public. I have not consented
to it being used for purposes other than that of obtaining government services.
A bias towards making collected data public has already caused some embarrassment to Data.gov.au with the
release of Medicare Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule data that was able to be re-
identified (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/medicare-pbs-dataset-pulled-over-encryption-
concerns/7888686) (see my earlier comments on Commitment 2.2).
Greater consideration should be given towards how individual consent is managed, particularly with regard to
the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. I should not be required to consent to an unlimited number of
unspecified research projects as a condition of accessing government services. I should not have to submit to
the Panopticon in order to pay my taxes.
Commitment 4.1
The most important aspect of this commitment is that of donations to political parties. Technology used for
casting, scrutinising, or counting votes is a distraction.
Disclosure of donations to political parties should be made in real time so that they can be scrutinised as they
happen. Disclosure months after the fact is neither reasonable, nor necessary. Listed corporations are subject to
continuous disclosure requirements, so why not political parties?
Disclosure of political doations should be published in machine readable format so that they can be readily
analysed by any interested parties, the better to hold political parties to account.
Anyone using an ABN has to file a Business Activity Statement with the Australian Tax Office every 3 months,
so I don’t see why political donations can’t be tracked as least as frequently. Given the importance of elections in
a democracy, more frequent disclosure of donations does not seem unreasonable.
Those departing political office should also be legally prevented from taking up a position with an entity they
were responsible for overseeing. There have been too many instances of Ministers leaving office and
immediately taking up a paid position at corporations with whom they had, or were likely to have had, official
dealings while in office. The current code-of-conduct system is too easily exploited by those who have neither
honour nor shame.
The Corporations Act 2001 section 307C and the APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants could
be used to inform a legal requirement to guard against conflicts of interest when leaving public office.Commitment 4.2
The National Integrity Framework is an overly complex, toothless arrangement that appears aimed at cynically
avoiding the creation of a federal Independent Commission Against Corruption similar to the state-based
NSW ICAC.
There is no credible reason not to have a federal ICAC with similar powers to that of the NSW ICAC, but with
jurisdiction that covers all aspects of the federal government.
Instead of mucking about with a complex array of inter-related entities, create a single, independent
Commission. Or explain to the Australian people why this is a bad idea, because I can’t see one other than fear
that existing practices might be found to be corrupt.
“If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.”

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Australia’s First Open Government National Action Plan 2016-
18 . My feedback is focused on open data.
I congratulate you on your decision to adopt the International Open Data Charter. In combination with the
Australian Government Public Data Policy Statement you have a strong set of principles to follow.
To adopt the International Open Data Charter requires responsibility assigned to implement a set of time-
bound, verifiable actions. I hope to see a level of community consultation in designing the action plan, or least
leveraging the feedback received via the Open Government Partnership and Data Availability and Use
consultations.
Both the policy and charter require you to release high-value, non-sensitive, data. I would suggest that data
specified in the ANZLIC Foundation Spatial Data Framework is high value and should be released for free.
This data is core reference data that make it possible to join many other datasets together. The release of the
Geocoded National Address File has been an excellent first step.
Both the policy and charter require publishing open data in machine-readable, open formats using open
standards. The adoption of the Open Contracting Data Standard is a first good step in publishing data using an
open standard. I believe you need to describe the process that you will follow to collaboratively agree on other
open standards and openly publish the collection of adopted standards. This will help others know how they
can publish their data so it can be compared and combined with Australian Government open data to create
further value.
One challenge in adopting an open data standard that is relevant to Australia is that standards that are
mandated by law are not openly accessible. For example, in trying to create a data standard to help people that
use wheelchairs access community facilities and public transport, standards such as AS1428.1 Design for
access and mobility must be purchased. This barrier has been recognised by the Parliament in the Netherlands
that recently passed a legislative requirement that all standards mandated by law must be made freely
available. It is good to see that some Australian standards, such as the Australian Building Codes are being
openly released and I hope to see this trend continue.
I support the principle stated in the Public Data Policy Statement that, “Australian Government entities will
ensure all new systems support discoverability, interoperability, data and information accessibility and cost-
effective access to facilitate access to data”. I think this could be expanded beyond just systems. For example
the copyright issues encountered in consolidating data for the National Public Toilet Map and the Australian
Flood Resource Information Portal have resulted in data not being released or significant work being required
to address rights issues. I would like to see the guidance on avoiding these issues made publicly available so
that more data be openly released.
Congratulations on Australia’s First Open Government National Action Plan, I believe it is a step in the right
direction.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.

Following stakeholder feedback, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet is extending the deadline for public submissions on Australia’s first
Open Government National Action Plan to 5pm AEDT on Friday 18 November 2016.

We look forward to hearing your views.
===============================================================================
The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever Open
Government National Action Plan for public consultation.

Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft Plan
through a variety of consultation activities which started in November 2015. An
Interim_Working_Group of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders
was also established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the
commitments.

Ahead of the upcoming final stage of consultation on Australia’s first Open
Government National Action Plan, PM&C is releasing engage2’s report on the
public consultation undertaken between November 2015 and April 2016.
engage2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by PM&C
to help design and lead a public consultation process up until April 2016. The
process is summarised in the OGPAU_Engagement_Report,  which also outlines the
outputs of the process, engage2’s lessons learned and recommendations to PM&C.
PM&C would like to thank Amelia Loye and the engage2 team for their efforts and
hard work.
The upcoming public consultation period on the full draft of the National
Action Plan is the final stage in this year-long consultation process to
develop Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan. Stay tuned to
this blog for more details.

On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in Sydney.
The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus
Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil society members
about their priorities for the open government agenda. Assistant Minister
Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate
as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open
data agenda and digital transformation of government.
In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on the
draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members agreed to work
together during this period to raise awareness about the Open Government
Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse range of stakeholders on
the draft Plan.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has written_to_the_Open
Government_Partnership to confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s
first National Action Plan.
The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow adequate time
for consultation within government and with the Australian public. The
timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that has been put into
developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group of senior public servants
and civil society stakeholders.
Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two weeks. The
Government will consider public comments before submitting the Plan to the Open
Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or sign_up
to the mailing list for updates!

Yesterday, the Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action Plan
met for the first time. Both government and civil society members were keen to
get down to the business of co-drafting Australia’s first National Action Plan.
The group talked about the need to develop an ambitious plan and had a
productive discussion about potential commitments that could be explored.
In addition to the commitments outlined in Agenda Item 4 (see: IWG_–_Meeting_1
–_Agenda_Item_4_–_Australia’s_National_Action_Plan), civil society
representatives also nominated access to information / FOI reform and a
national integrity system as areas for further discussion.
The final minutes from the meeting will be published this week, providing an
opportunity for the public to comment on the areas of potential focus for the
plan.

****** Interim Working Group for Australia’s National Action Plan – Expressions
of Interest ******
Posted on August_18,_2016  by  ogpteam
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.

****** Interim Working Group workshop ******
Posted on October_20,_2016  by  ogpteam
On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in Sydney.
The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus
Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil society members
about their priorities for the open government agenda. Assistant Minister
Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate
as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open
data agenda and digital transformation of government.
In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on the
draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members agreed to work
together during this period to raise awareness about the Open Government
Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse range of stakeholders on
the draft Plan.

=========================================================================
****** Introduction ******
In November 2015 the Australian Government committed to finalising membership
of the Open_Government_Partnership (OGP) and this public consultation was
launched to develop an Australian_Government_National_Action_Plan for open
government.
The Australia_page_on_the_OGP_website has a copy of the letter sent from the
Prime Minister to the OGP Co-Chairs and Support Unit expressing his commitment
to finalise Australia’s membership with the OGP.
The OGP is a voluntary, multi-stakeholder international initiative created to
promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new
technologies to strengthen governance.
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, being one of the
most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However,
there is always more that can be done. Through consultation, the aim is for the
first Australian Government’s National Action Plan to include ambitious actions
that support the OGP grand challenges of improving public servicesand better
managing public resources.
Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public service
delivery, increase the transparency and accountability of government, and
encourage greater public engagement. It also an opportunity for the public,
civil society, and the private sector to contribute ideas for how government
can achieve those goals.
A core requirement for OGP membership is that a two year National Action Plan
is developed publicly and transparently. The Australian Government invites you
to co-develop a vision and strategy for further progressing open government in
Australia, a strategy that outlines:
    * A vision for the future;
    * The history and status of open government in Australia;
    * Commitments to support the vision;
    * How government and the broader society can work together in achieving the
      vision; and
    * Ways to monitor and measure success.
The Australian Government’s OGP National Action Plan is expected to comply with
the Open_Government_Partnership_requirements. There is valuable guidance in the
Action Plans of other countries, such as the United_States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Indonesia. You can also review the full_list_of_OGP_countries on
the OGP site. You can read more about Australia’s engagement with OGP on the
OGP_Au_Background_page.
To contribute to the consultation, simply participate in the current
consultation stage. The National_Action_Plan_page outlines how each stage works
and how to contribute. We prefer public contributions to keep the conversation
open, so please also help in the peer review of ideas put forward throughout
the process.
We look forward to working with you on this exciting initiative.

****** January update from the coordination team ******
Posted on January_29,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood
Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
ogpau.wikispaces.com .

****** About the OGP ******
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a multilateral initiative and was
launched in September 2011 by the United States President, Barack Obama, and
the Brazilian President, Dilma Roussef.
The OPG was founded by eight countries – Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway,
Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. The eight
founding OGP countries have been joined by a further 61 countries bringing the
total to 69_participating_countries.
The OGP aims to secure commitments from governments to promote transparency,
increase civic participation, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to
make government more open, effective, and accountable. The OGP also fosters new
ways for citizens and governments to working together to solve common
problems. In the spirit of multi-stakeholder collaboration, the OGP is overseen
by a steering committee of governments and civil society organisations.
OGP member countries endorse Open_Government_Declarations and publish national
OGP_action_plans with specific_open_government_reform_commitments.
The OGP agenda is broad and extends to disclosure of interests, public ethics,
anti-corruption, service delivery, budgetary efficiency, public safety and
corporate accountability. Further details are available on the OGP website,
www.opengovpartnership.org.

***** Australian participation in the Open Government Partnership *****
The previous Australian Government indicated its intent to join the OGP in May
2013. In November 2015 the Australian Government launched this consultation as
part of the process to finalise OGP membership.
The Australian Government has committed to the OGP_Declaration_of_Open
Government and independent reporting of Australia progress by the OGP. The
Government will consult publicly to develop an Australian Government OGP
National Action Plan.
The Australian Government can now explore other ways to participate in the
various open government initiatives and working groups associated with the Open
Government Partnership. Any such initiatives Australia gets involved in will be
listed here.
***** Australia’s Open Government Efforts to Date *****
Please note: this content is currently in draft. please add your comments and
feedback in the comments below.
**** Open Reporting, Budgets and Parliamentary Processes ****
Australia has a long history of public sector and parliamentary open reporting.
All government entities are required to produce and publicly publish their
annual reports, budgets, contracts and a variety of other reporting
requirements for the purposes of oversight and transparency. The recent
independent_Review_of_Whole-of-Government_Internal_Regulation gives a good
outline of public sector reporting in the Australian Government. From a
Parliamentary perspective, Australia has also had a good track record, with a
high level of transparency and reporting across all Parliamentary_Business
including federal budgets, bills and legislation, transcripts from all
Parliamentary business, tabled documents, the work of Parliamentary
Committees and much more.
**** Australia’s original Declaration of Open Government ****
In 2009, the Gov 2.0 Taskforce was established to advise the Government on the
structural barriers and enabling policies for greater information disclosure,
digital innovation and online engagement. This included the division of
responsibilities for, and overall coordination of, these issues within
government. A Declaration_of_Open_Government was launched in 2010 (Archived).
In response, the Government made the Declaration_of_Open_Government and
accepted in full the recommendations in the Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for
Reform of Australian Government Administration report, both of which promoted
greater participation in Australia’s democracy, policy and legislative reform,
commitments to open government practices, and greater release of public sector
information.
**** Freedom of Information & Privacy Reforms ****
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was established in
2010 under the new Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. Over the
course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act 1982 was updated
making it easier to request information and seek review of FOI decisions.
Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the Freedom of Information
Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the Australian Information Commissioner
Act 2010 (AIC Act).
The Information Publication Scheme was (IPS) which implemented directing
agencies to take proactive steps to release standard government information in
a consistent way reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of the FOI Act.
In 2014 the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) were added to Schedule 1 of the
Privacy Act 1988. The APPs regulate the handling of personal information by
Australian government and some private sector organisations.
**** Platforms for Data Release ****
Data.gov.au was established in 2010 to enable the centralisation and
distribution of open data and access to government data APIs. The website was
allocated resourcing to initiate whole of government direction and curation of
data. In 2012, data.gov.au was allocated resources to strengthen its role as an
essential element in Australia’s open government strategy. The number of
datasets available on the website has grown from 500 to over 7,000, and is now
working in alignment with state and territory and local governments via the
Cross Jurisdictional Open Data Working Group to improve open data offerings
nationwide.
**** Adoption of Creative Commons ****
In order to accommodate greater access to government information and bring
consistency in licensing arrangements, the public service adapted Creative
Commons Attribution 3.0. The adaption of the license enabled all government
content with the exception of Commonwealth Coat of Arms and unless specifically
stated elsewhere. Details in the AGD_Statement_of_Intellectual_Property
Principles_for_Australian_Government.
**** National Commission of Audit ****
The National_Commission_of_Audit’s (2014) focus on improving the management of
public resources has enabled progressive whole of government changes in a short
time. The government has been proactive in addressing the recommendations
within the 2014/15 budget and in immediate organisational changes to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource management.
As part of the structural reforms following the Audit, we have seen
amalgamations of key government functions including the creation of the Data
Policy Branch within the Department of Communications. This branch is now
positioned to provide overall data policy direction on whole of government
initiatives including the development and implementation of the Australian
Government Open Data policy.
The Audit also recommended further centralisation, sharing, and reuse of
government resources with a focus on gaining from the opportunities innovation
in technology can provide.
**** Changes in culture ****
Open government practices and advances have a dramatic impact on the federal
and state and territory public services. The Australian Public Service is
learning to value the contribution which more transparent, interactive, and
open government practices can offer. It is benefiting from being a workforce
which is looking for improvements based on our public needs – not just to solve
problems when they arise, it is engaging with the public partnerships to
actively encourage private enterprise to provide public services, and it is
leveraging the skills and knowledge of the public to improve how it manages its

      This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the
      National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives
      Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it
      has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is
      the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in
      government through its legislated role of setting records and information
      management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and
      preserving and providing a public right of access to government
      information. The National Archives supports the consideration of open
      government efforts to date in development of the National Action Plan,
      and inclusion of a section covering this in the Plan itself.
      Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), the National Archives:
      • identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
      • preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth
      accessible;
      • oversees Commonwealth records management;
      • determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
      • imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.
      The Archives Act ensures that evidence of the most important decisions
      and actions of the Australian Government are identified and preserved ,
      and provides a right of access to this information. The National Archives
      submits that its role in providing the foundations for successful open
      government be recognised in the National Action Plan.
      The current background includes a section on Freedom of Information and
      Privacy reforms. The 2010 reforms also resulted in amendments to the
      Archives Act. The primary change was a reduction in the open access
      period (after which members of the public have a right of access to
      Australian government records) from 30 years to 20 years, phased in over
      a 10-year period to 2021. The Archives recommends that this change be
      included in the proposed section on Freedom of Information and Privacy
      reforms.
      In addition, the Archives recommends that a section be included on
      archival access to detail the right of access provided by both
      Commonwealth and state archival legislation to government records. In
      addition to the Commonwealth Archives Act, since the 1920s state archival
      legislation has established a right of access to government records. This
      long history of access to government records afforded by the various
      archival authorities should be recognised in the background on open
      government efforts to date.
      History of the National Archives
      For almost one hundred years, the National Archives has supported the
      principles of open government access through provisions for the
      regulation of the creation, management and destruction of records, and
      promotion of access to Australian government records.
      The need for a Commonwealth archival role was first recognised by Prime
      Minister Hughes in the 1920s, with the increasing volume of records and
      the effect or World War I creating an awareness of the historical value
      of some Commonwealth records. As a result, the Commonwealth National
      Library was tasked with regulating the destruction of records by
      Commonwealth agencies, to ensure that records that could prove valuable
      to future governments and historians were not destroyed. This sews the
      first seeds of open government, by ensuring that significant records were
      retained for future access by Australian citizens.
      The first body with formal responsibility for archives was the War
      Archives Committee which was created in the 1940s. With the initial aim
      of safeguarding the history of both world wars, this role grew with the
      end of World War II to oversight of the disposal of all past and future
      records and coordination of the archival work of the War Memorial and the
      Commonwealth National Library which had been designated as custodians of
      government records. Taking control of destruction was one of the main
      problems of the postwar years as temporary agencies wound up, as well as
      the need to save the money through the efficient disposal of records.
      There was at this stage no formal provision for public access to records.
      In 1966 however the Cabinet agreed to a general policy on access,
      introducing a 50-year rule, with World War I records available earlier.
      In 1970, in alignment with public access provisions in Britain, the
      Australian government adopted the 30-year rule, making records generally
      available for public access after they had been in existence for 30
      years. These provisions for public access to records are the first steps
      in open government.
      There was however still no archival legislation. An early attempt by the
      Parliamentary Library Committee in 1927 to pass an Archives Bill through
      Parliament had failed. In June 1978, a draft Archives Bill was introduced
      in the Senate as part of a package of administrative law measures with
      the Administrative Appeals and Freedom of Information Bills. The Archives
      Act was passed later than the other two Acts (1975 and 1982) in 1983 due
      largely to concerns with provisions for exemption from access. The
      Archives Act complements the right of access afforded by the Freedom of
      Information Act 1982, while also providing for the restriction from
      access of material of continuing sensitivity.
      The functions of the National Archives which are enshrined in the
      Archives Act– disposal of non-current records, custody of records of
      ongoing value and a right of access to these records – underpin the
      principles of open government and should be recognised in any overview of
      open government efforts to date.
      National Archives current initiatives
      The archival resources of the Commonwealth are a unique source of
      evidence and information about the nature of the Commonwealth Government
      and its activities. Identifying, preserving and making accessible the
      archival resources of Commonwealth is not only essential for the conduct
      of Australian government but also:
      • assists the Government and the public to scrutinise the decisions and
      activities of Commonwealth institutions;
      • allows the community to retain and transfer knowledge, learn from past
      experience, and protect the interests of Australians collectively and
      individually; and
      • helps satisfy people’s interest in the decisions and actions of
      Government that affected their and previous generations’ lives or shaped
      the development of Australia.
      The records that document and provide evidence of decisions and actions
      of the Australian Government provide a strong foundation for transparency
      and accountability. Australian Government records also hold information
      that is essential for policy development and the delivery of services.
      The National Archives’ more recent work in implementing the Digital
      Continuity 2020 policy and the Digital Transition Policy provides a
      valuable platform to assist Australian Commonwealth agencies to embed a
      culture of openness and transparency across government. When records are
      digital and managed well, agencies reduce duplication of effort, save
      time, save money and most importantly can share knowledge and information
      within and across agencies, as well as with the Australian community.
      Examples of the current efforts that the Archives will be contributing to
      the National Action Plan as part of its development will include:
      Digital and Online Access
      The National Archives holds over 362.8 shelf kilometres of paper and
      other analogue records and 462.5 terabytes of digital records in secure,
      environmentally controlled repositories around the country. In addition
      to providing access to our collection through our network of reading
      rooms, access is provided online via the Archives website and the
      collection database RecordSearch, as well as a number of specialised
      websites including Discovering Anzacs (defence service), Destination
      Australia (immigration) and Vrroom (for schools).
      The National Archives is also progressively digitising the collection to
      make items more accessible. As at the end of September 2015 over 41
      million pages had been digitised, with more being added each week. In
      2014-15, over 13 million records were accessed via the Archives website.
      We regularly consult with the public to identify items of the greatest
      significance to the Australian community and to make them available
      online.
      Digital Continuity 2020 Policy
      The Digital Continuity 2020 Policy centres on digital information
      governance and complements the Australian Government’s digital
      transformation agenda and the digital economy. The policy aims to support
      efficiency, innovation, interoperability, transparency, information re-
      use and accountability by integrating robust digital information
      management into all government business processes.
      The policy is based on three principles, with targets that agencies
      should reach by 2020, as well as a pathway identifying interim targets.
      All Digital Continuity 2020 targets are expected to be achieved as part
      of normal business reviews and ongoing technology maintenance and
      investment cycles.
      End to end digital project
      An ICT solution that develops capabilities to manage digital government
      information (born digital and digitised) to:
      • provide appropriate online access to all records as soon as possible to
      the public utilising available communication technology, at the time the
      records are required, and in a format and on platforms that meet their
      requirements;
      • incorporate mandated metadata enabling interoperability and sharing of
      information across Australian Government portals, and where appropriate,
      government business systems;
      • ingest, preserve and manage the Commonwealth’s digital records in the
      cloud ensuring their long term integrity, authenticity, and accuracy; and
      • provide cost effective and efficient sentencing of Commonwealth agency
      digital records and their transfer to the Archives.
      Legislative Reform
      The Archives Act provides a public right of access to Commonwealth
      records in the open access period. The Act was amended in 2011 to reduce
      the open access period from 30 years to 20 for Commonwealth records, and
      for Cabinet notebooks from 50 years to 30, with the reduction being
      phased in over a 10-year period.
      The National Archives jointly with the Attorney-General’s Department is
      currently developing a broad package of legislative amendments that will
      amongst other things, seek to address digital transformation related
      matters and improve equitable access to the Archives’ collection for all
      Australians.

      Information Commissioners (NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia)
      on December_11,_2015_at_5:43_pm said:
      The Role of Information Commissioners in Open Government
      The role of Information Commissioners across Australia is to encourage
      public sector agencies to champion open government and to promote the
      release of information to stakeholders and the community. All government
      activity originates in and is sustained by information. Increasing access
      to government information is fundamental to open, democratic government
      engagement with citizens and accountability. State and Territory
      Information Commissioners play a central role in facilitating improved
      information management and release to bolster transparency.
      The following information relates to New South Wales (NSW), Victoria,
      Queensland and South Australia.
      Information access laws across Australian jurisdictions
      Information access and Freedom of Information (FOI) laws across
      Australian jurisdictions are supportive of open government. The objects
      of each legislative regime demonstrate a commitment to open access of
      government-held information, transparency and accountability based on
      democratic principles, including to encourage community participation in
      decision-making. The information access regimes have, over the past few
      years, moved towards supporting and encouraging the proactive disclosure
      of information by public sector agencies to citizens and the community.
      • Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA Act): the
      GIPA Act commenced operation on 24 September 2010. In the second reading
      speech about the GIPA Bill, the then Premier Mr Nathan Rees stated that
      members of the public should be able to have access to the widest
      possible range of information to give them confidence in Government
      decision-making. He also stated that the GIPA Bill shifted the focus
      toward proactive disclosure.
      The GIPA Act is founded on a commitment to maintain and advance a system
      of responsible and representative democratic Government that is open,
      accountable, fair and effective. The object of this Act is to open
      government information to the public by (a) authorising and encouraging
      the proactive public release of government information by agencies, and
      (b) giving members of the public an enforceable right to access
      government information, and (c) providing that access to government
      information is restricted only when there is an overriding public
      interest against disclosure. The GIPA Act promotes the proactive
      disclosure of information through four information release and access
      pathways – mandatory proactive release of information; authorised
      proactive release; informal access; formal access.
      • Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Victoria) (FOI Act): The FOI Act
      commenced on 5 July 1983 and 5 July 1984. The object of this Act is to
      extend as far as possible the right of the community to access
      information in the possession of the Government of Victoria and other
      bodies constituted under the law of Victoria for certain public purposes
      by (a) making available to the public information about the operations of
      agencies and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting
      members of the public in their dealings with agencies are readily
      available to persons affected by those rules and practices; and (b)
      creating a general right of access to information in documentary form in
      the possession of Ministers and agencies limited only by exceptions and
      exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and
      the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom
      information is collected and held by agencies. Part II of the Act
      requires Ministers and agencies to annually publish a range of documents
      including policies and procedures affecting the public, categories of
      documents held, certain reports, as well as information about how members
      of the public may inspect and purchase documents.
      • Right to Information Act 2009 (Queensland) (RTI Act): The RTI Act
      commenced on 1 July 2009. The primary object of the RTI Act is to give a
      right of access to information in the government’s possession or under
      the government’s control unless, on balance, it is contrary to the public
      interest to give the access. Information may be accessed other than by a
      formal application under this Act, for example, the Act requires that
      significant and appropriate information held by agencies be made publicly
      available through publication schemes, preferably online. The RTI Act
      aims to make more information available, provide equal access to
      information across all sectors of the community, and provide appropriate
      protection for individuals’ privacy. Under the RTI Act, information is
      released administratively as a matter of course, unless there is a good
      reason not to, with formal access applications being used as a last
      resort.
      • Freedom of Information Act 1991 (South Australia) (FOI Act): the FOI
      Act commenced operation on 1 January 1992. The FOI Act gives every member
      of the public a right to:
      o access documents which are held by state government departments,
      statutory authorities, councils, public hospitals and universities,
      subject to certain exceptions in the Act; and
      o have records which concern their personal affairs amended, if those
      records are incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.
      In his explanatory speech on the Bill, the then Attorney-General, the Hon
      Chris Sumner MLC, talked of the three major premises on which the Bill
      was based: (1) the individual has a right to know what information is
      contained in Government records about him or herself; (2) a Government
      that is open to public scrutiny is more accountable to the people who
      select it; (3) where people are informed about Government policies, they
      are more likely to become involved in policy making and in Government
      itself. The objects of the Act are to promote openness in government and
      accountability of Ministers of the Crown and other government agencies
      and thereby to enhance respect for the law and further the good
      government of the State; and to facilitate more effective participation
      by members of the public in the processes involved in the making and
      administration of laws and policies.
      NSW, Victoria and Queensland have Information Commissioners who are
      independent statutory office holders.
      • NSW: The Information Commissioner oversights the operation of the GIPA
      Act. The Information Commissioner’s functions include to promote
      agencies’ understanding and practical application of the Act; measure,
      monitor and report on agency compliance; report on the operation of the
      GIPA Act to Parliament; and review decisions of agencies on request under
      the GIPA Act.
      • Victoria: the FOI Commissioner’s functions and powers include to
      promote understanding and acceptance by agencies of the Act and its
      object; to conduct reviews of decisions by agencies on requests under the
      Act; to receive and handle complaints; to monitor compliance by agencies
      with those professional standards; to provide advice, education and
      guidance to agencies in relation to compliance with any professional
      standards; to provide advice, education and guidance to agencies and the
      public; to report on the operation of the Act; to provide advice to the
      Minister on the operation and administration of the Act. In carrying out
      these functions the office the FOI Commissioner aims to ensure there is a
      fair and transparent flow of government held information, and to educate
      Victorians and the agencies that work on their behalf to understand their
      rights and responsibilities to one another.
      • Queensland: the Office of the Information Commissioner’s role includes
      independently review decisions made by Queensland Ministers and public
      sector agencies about access to or amendment of, documents; to mediate
      privacy complaints; promote information rights and responsibilities; and
      foster improvements in the quality of right to information privacy
      practices.
      The Information Commissioner is supported by two other statutory office
      holders appointed by the Governor-in-Council – the Right to Information
      Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner.
      South Australia does not have Information Commissioners and instead,
      relies on the Ombudsman to provide a complaint or review function, and to
      champion open and transparent government. State Records assists the
      Minister responsible for administrating the FOI Act. The Ombudsman is the
      review authority under the FOI Act for external reviews of agencies’
      decisions under the FOI Act (including in relation to access, amendment
      of personal records, and fees and charges).
      DISCLAIMER: This response has been provided by Information Commissioners
      and does not reflect the views of the respective State and Territory
      governments.

      Regarding background – in the culture section I think it is worth noting
      that:
      a) Groups of public servants, interested citizens and professionals
      working to advance the practice of Open Gov and Gov2 in Australia have
      formed to constructively support the development of Open Govt across
      Australia. Many of these events have occurred after hours and on weekends
      with attendees doing so out of interest, in their own time.
      b) There have been a significant number of Hackathons, GovCamps (and
      BarCamps) to advance the practice of Open Gov and encourage the use of
      Open Data in Australia.
      c) The Australia Government have hosted and sponsored a number of these
      events to engage citizens and business. In addition to these events they
      (you) have also hosted events to share Open Gov methods and tools with
      others across Government – which have been open to public participation.
      d) Even when these events were not ‘hosted’ or sponsored by Govt, they
      have been fairly well attended by public servants either as interested
      citizens and sometimes endorsed by their managers and on Gov / employer
      time.
      e) In addition to these events, Pia, as an APS staffer, and several
      others in her team have been accessible to, and promoted the initiatives
      of, others advancing Open Gov both inside and from outside of Government
      (at all levels) across Australia (and with other Countries).
      This above has helped maintained the momentum, interest and practice of
      Open Gov in Australia even though we have not formally had another Open
      Gov partnership – nationally or internationally.
      In saying all the above – I, and I can confidently say many of the others
      I have come across though my work in this field, do not underestimate
      what commitment to the OGP means and will be very pleased to see a
      National Action Plan.

      Perhaps understandably the material in the section Australian
      participation in the Open Government Partnership is an abbreviated
      positive version of the interrupted journey towards finalising membership
      of the OGP.
      The omissions in the section on Freedom of Information and Privacy
      Reforms, some of which are mentioned by James McKay however really
      distort the true picture.
      If the bill to abolish the OAIC is withdrawn and the FOI and information
      policy functions of the office adequately funded, fewer corrections would
      be needed.
      We can get by perhaps without a reference in this section or under
      Culture to Public Service Commissioner Lloyd’s opinion that FOI is ‘very
      pernicious.’ To then Australian Information Commissioner McMillan’s view
      that some agencies are ‘gaming the system.’ Or to Treasury Secretary
      Fraser’s observation that public servants these days don’t write
      sensitive stuff down.
      But if the National Commission on Audit is mentioned on the plus side,
      people like me remember the Australian Law Reform Commission Report
      Secrecy and Open Government never received a government response. That
      the Australian Information Commissioner made recommendations in a report
      that quickly disappeared about improvements to the review process. And
      that the privacy changes mentioned in the draft were Phase1 changes
      reflecting issues raised in the mammoth ALRC Privacy Report of 2007.
      Phases Two and Three of the government response never appeared again,
      although generously we could add that mandatory breach notification has
      just been delayed. Two of those lost causes were that the Commonwealth
      lead on national consistency regarding privacy protection, and a
      recommendation that Australia legislate a cause of action for a serious
      breach of privacy.
      The Platforms for Data Release Section is incomplete without reference to
      the findings in the report by your own department last week that weren’t
      uniformly positive.
      The Changes in Culture Section is the equal of the Australian
      participation in the Open Government Partnership Section in telling part
      of the story.
      Overall without listing all the warts the Background Section should be
      honest and realistic about where things stand. At the moment it reads
      like one of those rarely read annual reports that are brimming with good
      news and admit no failures or concerns.

      Perhaps it is worth explaining why many core datasets have been unable to
      be released. Some of these are cultural but others are structural.
      Government organisations such as the PSMA, Australia Post and the Bureau
      of Meteorology hold many core reference datasets that have not been
      released as open data e.g. Weather forecasts, postcodes, addresses, and
      more.
      The business models and funding arrangements for these organisations work
      against them publishing open data as the PSMA explain here https://
      www.psma.com.au/publications/news/delivering-benefits-through-open-data
      The closed nature of these datasets holds back Australia’s standing
      globally (e.g. http://index.okfn.org) but more importantly, inhibits the
      generation of value in a number of areas. The release of weather data is
      important to support both agriculture and disaster management. Addresses
      and Postcodes would be used by nearly every business in Australia. I
      can’t believe we can’t even publish State Boundaries as open data (http:/
      /data.gov.au/dataset/other-state-boundary-psma-administrative-boundaries)
      with the licence for personal use expiring on 30 Dec 2015.
      Perhaps there have been efforts to release this data – if so, they should
      be acknowledged. If not, then we have a nice segway into some future
      actions.

      It is wonderful to see Australia embracing this process at last after
      sitting on its hands and going in the opposite direction for so long.
      We note and endorse all of Steve Davies comments in his post on November

      Australia is suffering from 20th century policies that have resulted in a
      “hollowing out” of communities and also of civil society. This has meant
      a reduction in community participation and control of services and
      decision-making within communities. This has resulted in a loss of
      knowledge, skills, involvement, interest, and even more importantly, in
      the confidence needed to participate effectively. Our communities have
      disengaged from key issues affecting them, their communities and the
      country.
      This is no more apparent and more counterproductive than in services to
      the community provided by or funded by government. Many, like the jobs
      market and vocational training, have failed. Major community stakeholders
      and the community itself have been excluded from participation in
      planning as well as from implementation largely because they would have
      held contrary views and challenged implementation. This is well
      illustrated in aged care where even the Productivity Commission has
      commented on the adverse impact poor public awareness has had on the
      implementation of changes – changes where many would have advocated
      community involvement, better alternatives and better implementation.
      Open government cannot be effective and recognise its potential unless
      there is a knowledgeable, skilled and interested civic community of
      citizens willing to engage and participate. We have allowed our civic
      society to decay. Open government is primarily about engaging with civil
      society, which is where Australia is most deficient. It has instead
      focused on stakeholders who represent particular commercial, employee and
      other marketplace interests, so distorting the input that it gets.
      The most important grand challenge for Australia, if it is going to
      assume a leadership role in this endeavour and recover the ground it has
      lost, is to re-engage the community in the affairs of the community at
      all levels. I am writing to urge Australia to put “Participation” as its
      first “grand challenge” ahead of the two planned. “Improving Public
      Services” should be second as it is largely responsible for what has
      happened. Together they will set the scene for further developments.
      There is growing evidence showing the importance of community involvement
      in services to their communities – both to the success of the services
      and to building social capital and so rejuvenating civil society.
      The team behind Aged Care Crisis Inc. is addressing these problems and
      trying to bring aged care into the 21st century by opening discussion
      within the community and by making submissions to government inquiries.
      We are urging changes that would see community groups involved in the
      provision, in the management, in the control of, and in decision making
      at all levels of the aged care process. We want to see the development of
      a community with the knowledge and skills needed in the community, skills
      that are also required for effective open government. We urge government
      and those communities receiving other government services to adopt a
      similar approach.

      Observations around the text of FOI Reforms – the following statement is
      true:
      “Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act
      1982 was updated making it easier to request information and seek review
      of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the
      Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the
      Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act).”
      What is not mentioned is the current Government policy contained within
      the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill 2014 to
      actually roll back some of those reforms.
      In fact, since then, things have become harder, due to the miserly
      funding cuts doled out to the OAIC, frustrating their statutory
      obligations to promote the purposes of the FOI Act across the APS
      (although I must commend the OAIC for carrying on so determinedly with
      such few resources).
      Nor is there the acknowledgement that in 2013, a review in to FOI law and
      administration was carried out by Dr Hawke, with the number one
      recommendation being “that a comprehensive review of the FOI Act be
      undertaken”.
      There was no recommendation in that review to abolish the OAIC, which is
      part of the current bill before Parliament.
      If the “Background” to the actual status of Open Government in Parliament
      is muddied and presents a selective recent history, then the very
      principles of transparency are being undermined at the first turn.

      Time and again the issue of the culture of the Australian Public Service
      has been identified as being highly problematic for open government and,
      indeed, innovation.
      Through my work and many conversations what stands out is that there is
      considerable cultural resistance to engaging in open dialogue about the
      more extreme manifestations of the cultural short comings of the
      Australian Public Service.
      Four aspects of the culture stand out. They are as follows:
      1. Practices that generate large amounts of self-censorship.
      2. There is a lot of fear about having difficult and confronting
      conversations. So one of key challenges is to strip away that fear. To
      ensure, from the very first step, that all people – not just those who
      are ‘into open government’ – know (at its most elemental level), that
      it’s OK to speak out.
      3. The distorting impact of the obsession with the reputation of the
      public service being so severe that it generates destructive and self
      serving defensive routines. At its worse this results in systemic abuses
      of power (and there are many).
      4. The very low tolerance of challenging and dissenting views and
      information.
      I could go on and on, but suffice it so say these cultural artefacts (and
      more) are anathema to open government. Consequently, it is imperative (if
      there is to be any depth to open government), that these issues be
      publicly discussed.
      Doing so is essential to demonstrating to the public that the Australian
      Government is authentic about open government and encouraging engagement.
      If we fall into the trap (again), of not having these difficult
      conversations about the health of government and public service then we
      will be providing and weak platform for open government and Australian
      democracy in the 21st century. Let alone decency in government.
      By showing courage and being forthright about these issues I believe
      Australia could set a world leading example in relation to the Open
      Government Partnership.
      Cheers – Steve

***** What is “open government”? *****
Open government means different things to different people. Many countries
around the world are working on open government initiatives, each initiative
being defined differently and tailored to the needs of that country’s citizens
and government.
For the Open Government Partnership, it is the goal that governments will
“become sustainably more transparent, more accountable and more responsive to
their own citizens, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of
governance, as well as the quality of services that citizens receive.”
At the heart of open government are the ideas of transparency, participation
and accountability. As a working definition;
    * Transparency means the public understands the workings of their
      government
    * Participation means public can influence the workings of government by
      engaging with public policy processes and public service providers
    * Accountability means the public can hold the government to account for
      its policy and service delivery performance
Citizen engagement is what open government is all about. It underpins many of
the other topics in this guide – with active citizenship often being a vital
link between transparency and accountability. The Open Government Partnership
recognises this in its eligibility criteria, stating that: ‘Open Government
requires openness to citizen participation and engagement in policymaking and
governance, including basic protections for civil liberties’ (Open Government
Partnership).
***** What is the Open Government Partnership? *****
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) was launched in 2011 to provide an
international platform for domestic reformers to implement ambitious open
government reforms based on a number of commitments to make their governments
more open, accountable, responsive to citizens. Since then, OGP has grown from
8 countries to the 69 participating countries. In all of these countries,
government and civil society are working together to develop and implement
ambitious open government reforms based on a number of commitments to make
their governments more open and accountable. For more information visit the
Open_Government_Partnership website
***** What do countries need to do to be eligible to join the OGP? How many
meet these criteria? *****
To participate in OGP, governments must show a demonstrated commitment to open
government in four key areas – fiscal transparency, access to information,
disclosure of income and assets of elected or senior public officials and
citizen engagement. These are measured by objective indicators and validated by
independent experts.
In order to participate in OGP, countries must score at least 75% of the total
possible points available to them across the areas that are relevant to them.
Once countries have joined OGP, they are regularly assessed to ensure they
continue to abide by their commitments and their performance measures are up to
date.
Over 70 per cent of those countries which are eligible to join the OGP have
done so (based on 57 of 81 nations). Australia is considered eligible to join
and has now committed to finalising membership.
***** How does a country join OGP? *****
There are three requirements to join OGP:
    * making a commitment to the OGP Declaration of Open Government, which
      aligns with existing Australian Government policy and practice (ref http:
      //www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration);
    * developing a publicly consulted National Action Plan by July 2016 to
      submit to OGP with between 5-15 commitments that align to at least one of
      the five OGP “grand challenges”; and
    * undertaking an annual independent reporting of progress on the National
      Action Plan conducted by the Independent Reporting Mechanism of the OGP
      (ref http://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm).
More information can be located here: http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-
works/requirements
***** Can countries be expelled from the OGP once they become members? *****
Once a country’s action plan has been agreed, progress is monitored by both
other nations and civil society organisations, as well as by the Independent
Review_Mechanism_(IRM), to ensure all its promises are met. This independent
international expert group of the IRM will inform the Steering Committee if
they suspect a country as falling below the minimum eligibility criteria. The
Steering Committee can then review the participation of said governments. In
addition, governments are also being held accountable by civil society and
media in their countries and if they perform poorly in three successive
reports, participation can be reviewed.
***** How is OGP managed? *****
OGP is overseen by a multi-stakeholder international Steering_Committeethat
currently includes nine governments and nine leading civil society
representatives. The Steering Committee serves as OGP’s key executive
management body. The Steering Committee is led by a government chair, a
supporting (or incoming) government co-chair, and two civil society co-chairs.
More information on the OGP Steering Committee can be found here.
***** How does Australian intend to consult with the public? *****
The Open_Government_Partnership (OGP) requires broad consultation for the
development of member countries’ National Action Plans (NAP). This provides the
public, civil society, and the private sector with the opportunity to
participate in the process, and suggest commitments for governments to
undertake.
As described in the consultation process timeline below, the Government will
use the prioritised public-suggested commitments to guide the development of a
draft NAP. Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of what
will improve public services and improve management of public resources, as
well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities for business and
support innovation in Australia.
We look forward to your contributions to the consultation and public
discussions. We encourage you to contribute throughout the process and, as this
is a public consultation process, we prefer all contributions to be made
publicly for transparency and peer review.
***** What is the criteria for developing a national action plan? *****
Each participating country must develop an OGP National Action Plan (NAP)
through a multi-stakeholder, open, and participatory process. The action plan
contains concrete and measurable commitments undertaken by the participating
government to drive innovation reforms in the areas of transparency,
accountability, and citizen engagement.
The Australian consultation process was designed to be an open, transparent,
collaborative and citizen led as possible, with the support and approval of the
OGP Support Unit.
A core requirement for OGP membership is that every two years a National Action
Plan is developed publicly and transparently. The Australian Government invites
you to co-develop a vision and strategy for further progressing open government
in Australia, a strategy that outlines:
    * A vision for the future;
    * The history and status of open government in Australia;
    * Commitments to support the vision;
    * How government and the broader society can work together in achieving the
      vision; and
    * Ways to monitor and measure success.
The Australian Government’s OGP National Action Plan is expected to comply with
the Open_Government_Partnership_requirements. There is valuable guidance in the
Action Plans of other countries, such as the United_States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Indonesia. You can also review the full_list_of_OGP_countries on
the OGP site. You can read more about Australia’s engagement with OGP on the
OGP_Au_Background_page.
***** Why did Australia join the OGP? What are the benefits to Australia in
joining the OGP? *****
The goals of the Open Government Partnership align with Australia’s long and
proud tradition of open and transparent government. It also provides a
framework for the Australian Government to work directly with civil society,
the private sector and international partners to see what more can be done.
Joining the OGP is a unique opportunity for Australia to demonstrate leadership
in open government practices, to work alongside G20 counterparts in encouraging
cooperation and combating corruption, and to share knowledge on improving
public services and better managing public resources.
***** How is Australia’s performance tracked or reviewed? *****
OGP requires every participating government to engage in two forms of reporting
and assessment to promote maximum accountability of its performance in living
up to OGP commitments.  First, governments must publish an annual Self-
assessment Report after the end of each 12-month implementation cycle that
assesses government performance in making progress toward achieving its open
government commitments. Second, all OGP countries are subject to a bi-annual
assessment by the Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM). The IRM works
primarily through independent assessment reports for each OGP participating
government. Each report will assesses the development and implementation of
action plans as well as progress in fulfilling open government principles at
the country level.
***** How is progress measured? *****
The Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM) is a key means by which all
stakeholders can track OGP progress in participating countries. The IRM
produces biannual independent progress reports for each country participating
in OGP.  The progress reports assess governments on the development and
implementation of OGP action plans, progress in fulfilling open government
principles, and make technical recommendations for improvements. These reports
are intended to stimulate dialogue and promote accountability between member
governments and citizens.
http://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm/irm-reports
***** Which Minister is responsible and taking ownership of the process? Will
they be attending and representing Australia at relevant OGP events? *****
The Prime Minister is the responsible Minister for OGP in Australia.
***** Given there’s an election in 2016, what ensures the incoming government
will not drop or change the OGP National Action Plan? *****
Once the National Action Plan is finalised, it forms part of the independent
review of progress for Australia. Any potential change in government would not
change how we are independently reviewed.
***** What funding is being attached to meeting the goals in the National
Action Plan? *****
All commitments contributed to the consultation will be considered including
the financial considerations. Funding for OGP implementation cannot be pre-
empted until the National Action Plan is finalised, and is subject to
Australian Government consideration.
***** There was a tender for creating an OGP National Action Plan which was
carried out last year. Did this form the basis of the current process? *****
The current process was developed based on best practice public engagement
strategies with input and feedback from the OGP Support Unit and other
stakeholders. The earlier tender was to develop a draft national action plan to
assist in decision making which is now not necessary to use as the agreed
consultation methodology enables a fresh start that is driven by community
contributions. We feel this is a more appropriate approach for this process
than circulating a pre-developed plan for comment.
***** Is the focus going to be on open data or on a broader open government
topics? *****
Definitely on broader open government topics, the work is not limited to open
data in any way.
***** Is the government selecting a lead civil society organisation to work
with it on the OGP National Action Plan? *****
No, at this stage we are interested in working with all civil society
organisations as well as private sector, academia, cross jurisdictional
government participants and citizens themselves.
***** How can state and local governments participate in the planning process,
and will they be bound by the Federal OGP National Action Plan? *****
This is an Australian Government National Action Plan and although States,
Territories and Local Governments are welcome to contribute, they are not bound
by this agreement.
***** The OGP is starting to allow states, as well as nations to join. Would
the Australian Government be open to an Australian State or Territory joining
the OGP in its own right? *****
Currently only national governments are eligible to formally join OGP. However,
this does not mean there is no role for sub-national governments. National
governments can pursue sub-national open government reforms that involve state
and local governments as part of their commitments. As such, sub-national
governments are encouraged to participate in national OGP efforts to explore
the possibility of including local open government reforms in the OGP National
Action Plan of the country. – See more at: http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
about/faqs#sthash.e0rF0edz.dpuf
***** Given the initial consultation is occurring over the holiday season, how
much participation does the Australian Government actually expect from civil
societies and the community? *****
The consultation runs over 6 months which follows the OGP consultation
guidelines. Our experience is that the Christmas season provides a good
opportunity for people to think about how they want to contribute, with plenty
of time between Christmas and the consultation ending to contribute
meaningfully. People are welcome to contribute throughout the entire process.
***** How can I contribute to the consultation and developing the National
Action Plan? *****
There are key stages we need to meet to ensure consultations are completed by
the end of the June 2016 deadline. The scheduled timing for your input takes
into account the Christmas period. You can contribute online, in person at the
events, or by more traditional means, but all contributions will be added to
the online environment for peer review.
Please see the National_Action_Plan_Consultation page for full information on
the stages and how to contribute to each stage..

****** Preparing the National Action Plan ******
The Open_Government_Partnership (OGP) requires broad consultation for the
development of member countries’ National Action Plans (NAP). This provides the
public, civil society, and the private sector with the opportunity to
participate in the process, and suggest commitments for governments to
undertake.
As described in the consultation process timeline below, the Government will
use the prioritised public-suggested commitments to guide the development of a
draft NAP. Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of what

is a public consultation process, we prefer all contributions to be made
publicly for transparency and peer review.
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead
Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and will
coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&C will work with
other agencies across the Australian Public Service and other jurisdictions
within Australia to develop the NAP, including public consultation, to support
this work. We are keen to have representation and ideas from all parts of
society, including civil society, industry, academia, cultural sectors, and
from different areas of government in Australia.
You can subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list for updates and news.
Alternatively you can get website updates with the OGP_Au_RSS_feed. We will be
reporting progress on a regular basis.
Thank you in advance for your contributions, and in helping to shape
Australia’s first submission to the OGP.
***** Structure of the National Action Plan *****
The OGP advises that a country’s NAP should consist of 5-15 recommendations,
draw on at least one of the five ‘grand challenges’ defined by the OGP, and
address defined National Action Plan Principles.
**** Open Government Partnership ‘Grand Challenges’ ****
NAPs are developed drawing on at least one of the five ‘grand challenges’
defined by the OGP:
    * Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of
      citizen services including health, education, criminal justice, water,
      electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by
      fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation;
    * Increasing Public Integrity– measures that address corruption and public
      ethics,
      access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil
      society
      freedom;
    * More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address
      budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign assistance;
    * Creating Safer Communities – measures that address public safety, the
      security
      sector, disaster and crisis response, and environmental threats; and
    * Increasing Corporate Accountability – measures that address corporate
      responsibility on issues such as the environment, anti-corruption,
      consumer
      protection, and community engagement.
**** National Action Plan Principles ****
Each of the commitments made under an NAP must address at least one of the
following principles laid out by the OGP, so please consider these when making
your contributions.
    * Transparency: Publication of government-held information; proactive or
      reactive releases of information; mechanisms to strengthen the right to
      and open access to information.
    * Accountability: The rules, regulations and mechanisms in place that call
      upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon criticisms or
      requirements made of them, and accept responsibility for failure to
      perform with respect to laws or commitments. Ideally these should include
      the public.
    * Participation: Mobilisation of citizens on government policies or
      programs to provide input or feedback and make contributions that lead to
      more responsive, innovative and effective governance.
    * Technology and Innovation:Providing citizens with open access to and
      capability with technology for greater innovation. To be relevant to OGP,
      these initiatives must advance government transparency, accountability
      and/or public participation.

            //www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/subnational-government-
            pilot-program&quot;.
            I am engaging with State Government Open Government teams across
            the Country, inviting them to submit an action to the National
            Action Plan. I have been in touch with Gail from Premiers in SA.
            I'll send you an email so you have my contact details too.

      This national action plan is so convoluted and intangible it reads like a
      Greens initiative . All flourishes but completely hollow.
      To advance Australia our bloated commonwealth and state public servants
      must be drastically reduced in number. The Australian newspaper`s
      research today showed their employment conditions to be so much better
      than the private sector.
      Furthermore overseas studies show that for every public or quasi public
      sector job create between three to six jobs are lost in the private
      secots due to subsequent regulations and costs.
      Turnbull`s failure to cut or at least freeze service numbers indicates an
      unbelievable oversight or psychological capture by the Canberrs public
      service.
      Real actions not grandiose statements are needed as we plunge further
      down the steepening deficit slope.

            Hi Bill, thanks for the comment but it is worth noting that there
            is no national action plan at this stage, it is being developed
            over the coming 5 months, so we are curious about what you are
            commenting on. If you have any specific ideas about how to improve
            open government, please feel free to contribute to the
            consultation.
            Warm regards,

                  Hi Pia,
                  As I mentioned above public services would be improved by
                  cutting Commonwealth Public servant numbers. With nothing
                  useful to do the redundant public servants hold endless
                  talkfests and suggest and impose layers of regulations that
                  suffocate private companies from growing GDP,growing
                  employment and being productive. For example. why does the
                  Commonwealth have 4000 plus servants in the department of
                  Health and Ageing which is really a state responsibility?
                  This is why Australia is heading inevitably into a 2016
                  recession despite excessive government spending temporarily
                  propping up the economy.

      I can’t help but be extremely wary of this process.
      Having been involved in Senate Inquiries that achieve absolutely nothing
      in the past, even though the majority want change. I can’t see myself
      wasting time doing submissions that achieve nothing!
      Australia’s financial position is deteriorating quickly and it is
      unlikely the government can pick winners. Private enterprise is the only
      thing that can save our country, a National Action Plan run by Government
      won’t achieve much at all. Government just needs to get out of the way,
      but they won’t until the economy collapses or the global bankers turn the
      money off?

      I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
      membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational
      principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This
      is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those
      the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the
      design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.
      However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining
      membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in
      four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately
      disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil
      society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by
      this approach to ‘engagement’

      Doing away with the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) sounds like a crazy
      idea. But the UK Cabinet Secretary, Francis Maude in 2010 spoke about the
      hope of open data will remove the need for the FoI Act because “people
      won’t have to ask”. I think this is a very good premise to start with.
      Conservative think-tank, Policy Exchange, in a 2012 report said better
      use of data, technology and analytics could help the UK government save
      billions by improving efficiency rather than cutting services. It
      predicts the “data force” could save taxpayers up to £33bn per year. Not
      only could it save taxpayers money, it could improve public policy and
      importantly improve accountability and transparency of government
      decisions.
      In 2010 David Cameron campaigned on improving transparency and
      accountability. And in 2011 I was working at the Home Office at the time
      when they launched street-level crime maps, showing exactly what crimes
      had been committed across the whole of England and Wales. This example
      typifies what big data can achieve and one that goes to improving
      transparency and accountability.
      In the UK, every Secretary, Minister, political staffer and senior civil
      servant must publish details of meetings with external organisations,
      gifts (given and received), hospitality and overseas travel on a
      quarterly basis. Also an initiative that would go a long way towards
      making the system more accountable and transparent to taxpayers.
      The FoI Act is a powerful tool for the public. But the Government has a
      bill before the Parliament that seeks to undermine and weaken the Act.
      The bill would abolish the Office of the Australian Information
      Commissioner, an independent final place of appeal for those seeking
      documents under the Act. In anticipation of tearing down the office the
      government has stripped it of its funding – a mere $10.2 million over
      four years. The office faces the bizarre situation of still being in
      existence but with no money. Appeals to the office cost nothing but the
      government wants to charge people to appeal to the Administrative Appeals
      Tribunal – this will cost $861, plus legal advice and representation
      charges.
      This issue needs to be resolved before progressing the Open Government
      Partnership action plan. It is incompatible to have a bill before
      Parliament that seeks to undermine the very principles being set out in
      this important task.
      Contrast this with the US where two Senators from either side of politics
      have teamed up to strengthen their FoI Act. The Senate passed the bill by
      unanimous consent. It then was sent to the House of Representatives,
      which had already passed its own version of the reforms by an
      overwhelming vote of 410-0. Given the current political climate in the US
      to achieve such bipartisan agreement on anything is nothing short of a
      miracle. But it does show the importance both sides hold to appearing to
      improve accountability and transparency.
      I welcome this process and congratulate the Government for committing to
      develop a national action plan.

      Hi Pia,
      Just a couple of comments, now that we’re getting to the point of doing
      things globally.
      You’d appreciate that there’s a parallel org to the ogp – the civil
      society end of gov – so we’ll be able to give you some comparative
      feedback on how you go about building the Action plan.au. http://
      www.ogphub.org/napreview-pilot/
      Obviously one of the major products of these plans will developing is a
      “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (built around a citizen’s ID). So we can
      expect (with your imagination) that ad hoc/buckshot approaches like the
      gov 2.0 taskforce will start firming up into a platform which may be used
      by gov, and civil society, groups around the world. http://open4m.org/
      about-us/
      You’re very lucky to have many existing groups of correspondents in
      various countries already that span between the internal groups of a
      government and the civil society groups with which they coordinate
      “actions”. e.g. http://forum.opengovernment.org.uk/groups/ogp
      One more note as you say “NZ and other governments have generally
      established their groups after getting the national action plan
      developed”. That’s not what they are telling others. “New Zealand (as
      one) is in the process of setting up a Stakeholder Advisory Group to
      assist with developing, implementing and evaluating their plans”. http://
      www.ogphub.org/blog/advancing-ogp-in-asia-pacific/
      Personally I prefer the way you’re going about it – keeping things open.
      As Shreya (your OGP contact in Singapore) says in the doc above, “The
      important thing now is to sustain the positive momentum generated by OGP
      and create permanent dialogue mechanisms, with clear terms of reference,
      representation drawn from groups that go beyond the ‘usual suspects’ and
      regular meetings to strengthen the impact of the OGP process on
      government-civil society engagement and to mitigate against risks posed
      by changes in leadership.”
      “Citizen’s Engagement Platform” (as the English call it). “Permanent
      Dialogue Mechanism”, “Knowledge Exchange”; call it what you want. That’s
      one deliverable which every gov wants delivered before the “action”
      really starts.

      the flavour of talking to an intelligent being with thoughts and
      responses capable of conveying personal inclinations and values without
      expressing them in anodyne form until they’ve been run up the line for

      This is welcome news, and appreciate the thought that has gone into
      design of consultative steps so far.
      Two comments.
      One, you state
      “At this stage, it is envisioned that the first Australian Government’s
      NAP will focus on the two OGP grand challenges of:
      • Improving Public Services – measures that address the full spectrum of
      citizen services including health, education, criminal justice, water,
      electricity, telecommunications, and any other relevant service areas by
      fostering public service improvement or private sector innovation; and
      • More Effectively Managing Public Resources – measures that address
      budgets, procurement, natural resources, and foreign assistance.”
      Many outside government might ponder the ‘envisioning’ without outside
      input that led to this choice of these two challenges from the five laid
      out by the OGP, leaving this challenge off the agenda:
      “. Increasing Public Integrity—measures that address corruption and
      public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media
      and civil society freedom.”
      Two, experience elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group
      can enhance the partnership concept and add value. There is no mention of
      such a body in the published material. NZ, well into the process is just
      one of many countries that have now gone down this path.
      http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1508/S00042/advisory-group-for-open-

      Looking forward to taking things forward.

            Thanks Peter for the feedback and support. Regarding the challenges
            chosen, for the first national action plan it seemed appropriate to
            kick off with a few specific ones but we have taken on your comment
            and will consult on the key themes for future national action
            plans. They are redone every two years.
            Regarding the advisory group, that sounds like a good idea to
            contribute as an action for the government to consider, so please
            add that suggestion to stage 2 of the consultation. NZ and other
            governments have generally established their groups after getting
            the national action plan developed, so in the meantime we will
            reach out and discuss the model with those jurisdictions.

                  Hi Pia
                  I agree, It does make sense to kick off with specific
                  challenges. That being said I also think it makes sense to be
                  prepared to highlight issues of culture, customs and practice
                  where they pose significant risks to dealing with those
                  challenges on there ground.
                  I’d say those components would fall into three categories.
                  Those that can be easily dealt with right away, those that
                  can be spun off as short term project (1-3 months), and those
                  that are of such significance that they would constitute a
                  major new initiative by government. Or could easily be
                  earmarked for inclusion in subsequent actions plans.
                  I think the guiding light within that should be along the
                  lines of speed and agility. Better than a lock step approach
                  IMO.

****** Next steps to finalise Australia’s first National Action Plan ******
Posted on October_18,_2016  by  ogpteam
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has written_to_the_Open
Government_Partnership to confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s
first National Action Plan.
The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow adequate time
for consultation within government and with the Australian public. The
timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that has been put into
developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group of senior public servants
and civil society stakeholders.
Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two weeks. The
Government will consider public comments before submitting the Plan to the Open
Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or sign_up
to the mailing list for updates!

****** OGP Update – 3 August ******
Posted on August_3,_2016  by  ogpteam
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

****** OGPAU theme teleconference times ******
Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye
If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

      Gosh. There’s late notice and then there’s late notice 🙁
      I appreciate getting an email invite (since I didn’t hear about this any
      other way) but the email was sent after close of business on a 4 day long
      Easter weekend for a call happening the day everyone’s back from holidays
      (not to mention 2 days out from the deadline).
      I’m very disappointed to be unable to participate due to this lack of
      notice.

            Hi Henare. Thanks for posting the links Henare. I invited everyone
            who had suggested an action under a theme to attend and posted the
            link to register on the wiki pages for each theme. These events are
            being held to encourage and complement three way engagement on the
            wiki. I am also adding summaries of discussions on each theme pages
            of the wiki to boost three way engagement. The intent is to be as
            available as I can to those of you suggesting actions before
            submissions close Thursday. My team scheduled the Ongoing
            Engagement session as our first event, but I thought it should be
            last based on theme based discussions so needed to modify in
            eventbrite before posting the link. Those who have suggested
            actions under this theme received an email invitation on Thursday.
            I’ve been unwell this weekend and in teleconferences most of today
            so forgot to post it on the theme – thanks for the reminder. Amelia

members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the collaborative
spirit of the OGP.
The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely competitive
field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public engagement with Australia’s
process to join the OGP. They bring a wide breadth of experience across a range
of fields relevant to open government, and represent a diverse range of
interests and sectors.
Meet the civil society representatives:

      Council of Australia and has also previously served as the President of
      the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the Victorian Bar, and as a

      leadership experience to her role as co-chair, and substantial experience
      working with government, corporate and non-government sectors. The Law

      processes related to transparency and strengthening the integrity of
      public offices.

this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to help
co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership
(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to
ogp@pmc.gov.au by 5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.
See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan on_this_wiki.
Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.

The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.

Agencies have come up with either in response to submissions received, or from
their own research and analysis.
The outlines of these are below, and they will be open for discussion at the
public workshop.
    * Centralised Annual Report discovery portal

    * Scoping a public consultation platform
    * Scoping an e-Tabling system
    * Transforming high volume services
In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the
commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki and
other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy to read, in
line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is available for download
at National_Action_Plan_DRAFT_v5_–_For_Release
We have also posted the text onto the wiki at http://ogpau.wikispaces.com/

Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the
wiki.Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.
Save the date! Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-
create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on
the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to
lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action
with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for
us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.
Need help? This how_to_Suggest_an_Action_document_provides_some_tips. It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.
In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on
the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:
    * Engagement_for_OGP
    * Fiscal_Transparency
    * Fostering_Innovation
    * Freedom_of_Information
    * Government_Integrity
    * Open_Data
    * Public_Participation
    * Public_Service_Delivery
    * Resources_Management
We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each
action suggested.
Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these themes
with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have
also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to
get involved. PM&C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the
11th April workshop.
***** Some questions that emerged during engagement last week *****
    * After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the
      process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?
    * How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of
      the Grand Challenges?
    * What happened to the proposed teleconference?
    * How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?
Responses to your questions
Cocreation – The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting
actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team,
but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra
will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come
together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can
only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host
theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP commitment_templates with you.
Grand challenges – The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges
are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of
these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions
suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will
share more about Government’s position on this soon.
Teleconference –I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to
invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others
who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities,
differences and priorities before the 11th April event.
Working together to prioritise actions – We need to work together to prioritise
suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to
help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop
on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:
    * Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
      discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they
      might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.
    * In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you who
      have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or
      30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we
      can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.
***** Actions that you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Encouraging theme based engagement– I will be running teleconferences
      with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have
      suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about
      this.
    * Encouraging feedback from others on actions –actions have now been themed
      into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are
      looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and
      opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise
      with you at the workshop.
    * Connecting Australians to theworking_groupsand Open Government
      Partnership Support Unit,Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
      shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Networks.
Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will
include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might
be more involved.

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of
      the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others
      you like.
    * Researching OGP NAP review reports to understand how Australia might be
      assessed and what actions should include.
Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss
your ideas and ways you might be more involved.

****** What_I’m_learning_about_Open_Gov_in_Australia ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available
                  to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the
                  OEH website.
                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.

****** Submission_from_the_Australian_Open_Government_Network_(AOGPN) ******
Posted on February_3,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood

This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open
Government Network on February 2 2016.
===============================================================================
 
Australian Open Government network
I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and
organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of
Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and
participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on
areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true
spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of
priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
    * Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
    * Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
    * Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
    * Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash
      University)
    * Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
    * Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
    * Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
    * Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the
process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil
Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more
comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to
contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.
The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the
government moves ahead on this important initiative.
Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how
government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of
Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.
While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic
and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage
participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members
of the public.
While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information
sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and
entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be
substantial national engagement activity.
The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the
OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been
no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his
Cabinet Ministers.
While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs
announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily
available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime
Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation
website.
As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to
public attention.
Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.
The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice
were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national
campaign of engagement.
Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in
recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials
published online. However these materials are not readily available to
interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.
In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a
challenge even for those aware of the process.
While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there
is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely
taking place.
It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at
risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of
Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of
insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.
General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced
it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include
Public Integrity.
Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of
consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing
to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have
been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.
The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the
necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP
initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the
lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society
together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision
making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself
with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs
provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that
Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and
timeline.
The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil
society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for
the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.
The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states,
territories and local government must be part of the open government journey.
The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open
government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian
Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a
discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.
The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future
of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that
should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal
of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.
The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s
proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent
government.”
As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan,
wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go
through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”
Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background
material.
At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of
the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN
General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti
corruption matters.
The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight
governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.
Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan
required by the convention.
The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/
Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership
role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.
The Plan states:
     “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our
     government agencies, policies, and officials implement international
     best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The
     (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement,
     open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public
     officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public
     officials as issues which merit particular attention.”
The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:
     “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
     committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
     corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-
     Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on
     Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our
     companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption.
     Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is
     essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open
     Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in
     Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset
     disclosure frameworks…”
The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level
Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for
Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data
Principles.
Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the
consultation proceeds.

website.

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
ogpau.wikispaces.com .

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://
      ogpau.wikispaces.com/
    * A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air
      ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to
      the consultation. Please subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list to indicate
      your interest in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to
      present their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where
      and when this forum will take place will be published on this website
      closer to the date.
    * You can add comments to this Stage 2 Blog post (below).
    * Tweet your thoughts to #ogpau.

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.
The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:
Brisbane:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)

****** Consultation_Stage_1:_Preparation,_Framework_and_History ******
Posted on November_17,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.
Pia Waugh (OGPau National Action Plan Coordinator, PM&C)
***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****
Please add your comments to the draft Background_page for any additional
efforts to date.

****** Results of the co-creation workshop and ongoing engagement ******
Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye
Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.
See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan on_this_wiki.
Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.
Amelia

their own research and analysis.
The outlines of these are below, and they will be open for discussion at the
public workshop.
    * Centralised Annual Report discovery portal
    * Create a Digital Marketplace

    * Transforming high volume services
In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the
commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki and
other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy to read, in
line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is available for download
at National_Action_Plan_DRAFT_v5_–_For_Release
We have also posted the text onto the wiki at http://ogpau.wikispaces.com/

****** Stage three: prioritisation and drafting workshop ******
Posted on April_9,_2016  by  amelialoye
Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government
have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the wiki.
This marks the end of Stage_2_of_our_engagement_process, which was designed to
raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31st March.
We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations.
The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.

****** Submission from the Australian Open Government Network (AOGPN) ******
Posted on February_3,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood
This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open
Government Network on February 2 2016.
===============================================================================
 
Australian Open Government network
I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and
organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of
Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and
participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on
areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true
spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of
priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
    * Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
    * Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
    * Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
    * Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash
      University)
    * Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
    * Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
    * Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
    * Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the
process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil
Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more
comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to
contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.
The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the
government moves ahead on this important initiative.
Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how
government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of
Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.
While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic
and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage
participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members
of the public.
While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information
sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and
entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be
substantial national engagement activity.
The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the
OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been
no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his
Cabinet Ministers.
While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs
announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily
available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime
Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation
website.
As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to
public attention.
Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.
The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice
were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national
campaign of engagement.
Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in
recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials
published online. However these materials are not readily available to
interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.
In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a
challenge even for those aware of the process.
While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there
is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely
taking place.
It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at
risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of
Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of
insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.
General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced
it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include
Public Integrity.
Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of
consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing
to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have
been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.
The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the
necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP
initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the
lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society
together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision
making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself
with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs
provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that
Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and
timeline.
The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil
society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for
the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.
The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states,
territories and local government must be part of the open government journey.
The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open
government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian
Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a
discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.
The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future
of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that
should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal
of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.
The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s
proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent
government.”
As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan,
wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go
through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”
Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background
material.
At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of
the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN
General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti
corruption matters.
The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight
governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.
Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan
required by the convention.
The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/
Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership
role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.
The Plan states:
     “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our
     government agencies, policies, and officials implement international
     best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The
     (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement,
     open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public
     officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public
     officials as issues which merit particular attention.”
The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:
     “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
     committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
     corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-
     Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on
     Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our
     companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption.
     Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is
     essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open
     Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in
     Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset
     disclosure frameworks…”
The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level
Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for
Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data
Principles.
Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the
consultation proceeds.
Please publish this submission on the Open Government Partnership Australia
website.

      Hi Amelia,
      I understand and welcome the sentiments behind your initiative to
      facilitate dialogue before the government run event on 11 April between
      those who have submitted suggestions for commitments on the same theme.
      But to receive an invitation on Thursday before Easter to participate in
      teleconferences at nominated times on Tuesday and Wednesday, the first
      days after the Easter break, is unlikely to lead to optimal engagement.
      Tuesday is a shocker for me personally although I will give it a shake
      including 1530-1630 the times allocated for Freedom of Information, a
      topic especially important to me and in the scheme of things, a subject
      of central importance when we are talking about reforms to advance open
      transparent government.
      Another member of the Network, one of Australia’s leading authorities on
      access to information issues tells me he is away over the break including
      these days when he will be remote from any opportunity to participate.
      The Australian Open Govenment Partnership Network and its members are
      interested in the full range of themes but our resources are such that
      dropping everything to participate over two days at such short notice is
      just not possible.
      Sure we can attempt to connect up ourselves but the limited notice at
      this time of the year-the most ‘away’ time on the Australian calendar-
      shouldn’t go unremarked.

            Thanks Peter, I understand. I just want to ensure we make the most
            of the time we have. I have seen some people commenting on others
            suggestions on the wiki and want to encourage more of that kind of
            three way engagement. As stated, I thought it would be useful to
            introduce everyone making submissions before they close on
            Thursday, and before the event in Canberra on the 11th. I
            understand not everyone will be able to make these times,
            particularly given the short notice and time of year. These events
            have been designed, responsively, to complement engagement through
            the wiki and the email invitations are an introduction to further
            engage with each other. I will also post the notes from each
            teleconference under themes to encourage more ongoing discussion
            online. Amelia

****** Submission from the Accountability Round Table to the Interim Working
Group ******
Posted on September_5,_2016  by  ogpteam
This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Accountability
Round Table on 4 September 2016.
===============================================================================
On Saturday, the AGM of the Accountability Round Table Ltd took place. (for
details re the ART – https://www.accountabilityrt.org/about/) .  It will not
surprise you to know that the topic of the Australian OGP Action Plan was an
agenda item.  Among other things, the selection of the civil society members of
the IWG was discussed and strongly supported.
You will appreciate that ART wishes to assist where it can. We decided that we
should, at least, forward the most recently published material of ART relevant
to the matters that we submit should be addressed in the NAP. The areas of
major concern comprise
    * the need to establish a National Integrity System,
    * the need to address the problems associated with political funding and
    *  the urgent need to restore resources to the OAIC and appoint the 3
      Statutory Commissioners to enable the OAIC to again discharge its
      statutory functions.
During the recent Commonwealth Election, ART sought commitments from the
Coalition, ALP and Greens on these issues and supported those requests with
background material.  That material is included at this link: Submission_OGPIWG
Attachment1.
There are also two recent relevant publications:
    * the recent ART submission to the Commonwealth “ Establishment of a
      National Integrity Commission” Parliamentary  Committee.  (http://
      www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/
      Establishment_of_a_National_Integrity_Commission/NIC/Submissions – 
      Submission 31)
    * the recent paper by one of our members, Prof Colleen Lewis, ( for the
      John Cain Foundation) on political funding – http://
      www.johncainfoundation.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jcf-come-clean-
      political-donations.pdf .
Dr Lewis’s paper also includes the most recent discussion of the “public office
public trust principle”, the principle you will see referred to in the
attachment.
We hope that this material will be of assistance to the IWG. If there are any
issues or questions arising out of these matters, we would welcome the
opportunity to assist.
We ask that this email and the attachment be placed on the Government website
as a submission of ART.
Yours Sincerely
Tim Smith
Chair of the Accountability Round Table.

this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other details of the Interim
Working Group’s progress.
Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.
The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:
Brisbane:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-brisbane-information-session.eventbrite.com
Sydney:               15 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time)

event
Melbourne:          17 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-melbourne-information-session.eventbrite.com
Please note: the Brisbane session is being run immediately prior to an Open
Data Institute Queensland event, hence the timing and shortened session.

Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.
Amelia Loye

Selection process
The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C received
around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society positions on the
Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior executives from key
agencies to represent the Government on the Interim Working Group.
PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the call
for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked by
suitability against these criteria, which included their experience and
expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in engaging
with stakeholders and/or government.
We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the applicants
were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a number of factors
(e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a variety of sectors and
indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant skills). The selected civil
society representatives provide a good mix of experience across the spectrum of
open government issues, and bring a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to contact
OGP@pmc.gov.au for feedback on their application.

(OGP).
The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society consultations
conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed commitments submitted by
stakeholders can be accessed here.
The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for possible
inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be considered by the
Government before its submission to the OGP by 1 November 2016.
A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working Group
and arrangements for membership can be accessed here. The draft Terms of
Reference will be considered by the Interim Working Group at its first meeting.
This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to provide
a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify new initiatives
over time that will strengthen transparency, accountability and public
participation in government.
Process
The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of civil
society stakeholders.
EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to supporting
transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim Working Group
will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a civil society
representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are interested in co-
chairing the Working Group.
Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able to
attend:
    * a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
    * a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).
Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work with civil
society groups to help cover travel costs and associated expenses for the
workshop.
In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:
    * the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
      geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and industries);
    * experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
      stakeholders and/or government; and
    * for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.
EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via email to

=========================================================================
****** What I’m learning about Open Gov in Australia ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye
I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available
                  to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the
                  OEH website.
                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
                  methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
                  that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
                  through social media.
                # Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
                  drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in
                  OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify
                  and train key staff who can help determine barriers and
                  enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider.
                  Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve
                  responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and
                  speed up approval for the release of open data.
                # Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
                  resource management programs such as the coastal reforms
                  project.

      The list appears comprehensive-ish, and forgive me if I have missed the
      mark when it comes to accessing government records, information and data.
      All jurisdictions will have an Records/Archives authority. Each of which
      provides access to records that are in jurisdictions open access period.
      Open access periods vary in each state and territory – but it still it is
      an opportunity and function that has been over-looked in this list.
      Federal/Commonwealth:
      National Archives of Australia – (and reading through the site, I have
      seen that they have provided some comment on some parts)
      Under the Archives Act 1983, the National Archives has two main roles:
      – to preserve Australia’s most valuable government records and encourage
      their use by the public; and
      – to promote good records management by Australian Government agencies.
      In fulfilling these responsibilities, we ensure that Australians have
      access to a national archival collection so they may better understand
      their heritage and democracy (taken directly from their website – about
      us)
      They have a records search function and also areading room which provides
      appropriate access to commonewealth held records to australian community.

      Open Government is a great initiative and there is so much opportunity to

      services available in accessing government records.

Vision
Why open data?
Better, faster, more open data
NSW Government agencies:
Better
Faster
More
Release better data in
accessible, consumable
formats with metadata
and quality statements
Release data faster using
automated processes,
standard data categories
and trusted user models
Release more data and
make it discoverable
through central portals
Open data is a tremendous resource.
It provides the intelligence for insight,
invention and exploration that translate
into better products and services that
improve everyday life and encourage
business growth.
Research shows that open data has a significant
impact in four key areas:
•	 improving government
•	 empowering citizens
•	 creating opportunity
•	 solving problems.
The NSW Open Data Policy has contributed to improved
outcomes for vulnerable populations protecting the
environment, good government, and road safety.
The review of the policy in 2016 renews the NSW
Government commitment to open data to support;
transparency, innovation, and new knowledge and
insights from combined data sources.

which are leading to business growth
and to improvements in everyday life.
Open Government, Smart Cities, the Data
Analytics Centre and the NSW Open Data
Advocate are some of these initiatives.
Open Government
A smart government is transparent and accountable,
and understands that solutions to policy challenges
can come from outside government. It collaborates
with community and industry partners, encourages
participation in the policy formulation and decision
making process, and encourages innovation from
employees and external stakeholders.
Public service agencies are now more open and
collaborative as a result of the reforms commenced
under the Strategy. By 2014, the amount of information
the NSW Government published online had more
than doubled, more agencies conducted customer
satisfaction surveys than in previous years, and most
NSW Government agencies now had social media
policies in place to better engage with customers.
This shows a deeper involvement with the community
and a commitment to ensuring that there are multiple
contact points within government for customers.
Smart Cities
Smart cities are generally considered in terms of using
technology to connect infrastructure such as transport,
health, energy and water, generating data that can be
used for better services and better planning. Open
data makes this information available to everyone, from
families to retailers, commuters to investors. Open data
allows everyone to understand and interact with our
cities, to contribute to their growth and development.
The DAC works with data from a variety of sources,
including open data, to derive insights that support
strategic decision making, evidence based policy
development and improved service delivery.
The DAC advises agencies on how data can be
opened to the public in line with the Open Data Policy,
including de-identification.
NSW Open Data Advocate
The Information Commissioner promotes public
awareness and understanding of the object of the
GIPA Act: to open government information to the
public including authorising and encouraging the
proactive public release of information by agencies.
The Information Commissioner has taken on the role
of NSW Open Data Advocate. The Open Data Advocate
will play a key role in ensuring that the new Open Data
Policy is successfully implemented. Activating the role
of Open Data Advocate will provide assistance to
citizens making a request to access information, and
provide advice to agencies to streamline processes
for data release.
The Information Commissioner may investigate and
report on the exercise by agencies of their functions
under and compliance with the GIPA Act, and can
investigate complaints made about an agency’s conduct
in carrying out its functions under the GIPA Act. This
independent regulatory oversight role promotes
accountability and public confidence in the release and
management of data by government sector agencies.
The Information Commissioner oversees the
transparency obligations of agencies in the GIPA Act
including that:
•	agencies must make information publicly available
as open access information under Part 3 Division 1
of the GIPA Act
•	disclosure logs where agencies must record
information that has been requested formally and
which the agency decides may be of interest to
other members of the public (Part 3 Division 4).
The obligations of agencies are outlined in Part 3
Division 2 Agency Information Guides.
NSW Government Open Data Policy
2NSW Government
Open Data Policy
Progress to date
In 2009, the Government Information Public Access Act
(GIPAA) established NSW Government’s commitment
to opening government information, proactively and
responsively, to the public. Data NSW was launched as
the first State level open data catalogue in the world.
In 2013, the Open Data Policy was introduced to
support simple and efficient compliance with GIPAA
and encourage the release of high value datasets for
use by industry and the community. The Policy aimed to
assist agencies in embedding open data principles in
their operations.
Data NSW now receives between 3,000 and
5,000 visits every month. The site contains
approximately 350 catalogue entries which provide
access to over 50,000 government datasets, which are
published on agency portals. This approach allows open
data to be searched in a central location, but also made
available alongside data on the same subject – such as
education,
health or environment. Data NSW has also been
federated with open data portals from other
jurisdictions so that a search will provide links to
datasets from South Australia, Queensland and the
Commonwealth Government.
NSW Government has adopted an open access licensing
framework to support the release and reuse of public
information. We have also adopted the Australian
Bureau of Statistics framework for standard data
quality reporting.
The 2016 policy drives the release of more data, in better
open formats, using automated processes for faster
publication. The newly established Open Data Rolling
Release Schedule indicates agency targets to improve
the openness of their published data and to release new,
high value datasets.
Land and Property Information is now providing
spatial data, such as the NSW Cadastre, imagery and
administrative boundaries, as web services. The NSW
Address Location Service web service allows the user
to enter an address and pinpoint the location of that
address. The web services allow users to access the
most up to date information without having to store and
maintain it in their own systems or applications.
The web services can be used in multiple ways e.g.
direct use, mashups, mobile apps and spatial systems.
The NSW Education Datahub is a searchable central
repository of publically available data with a range of
video tutorials on using it. Department of Education
is also a partner in the Code for Australia fellowship
program. The Fellowship Program pairs civic-minded
technologists, designers and community organisers with
a government agency for a 12-month collaboration.
For example, to develop a service that uses education
and location data to make it easier for parents and
carers to select a school for their children.
Information Management Framework
The NSW Government Information Management
Framework (the IM Framework) establishes a common
approach to managing government data
and information.
The IM Framework is made up of policies, standards
and guidance for managing data and information
consistently across the sector. It enables agencies
to appropriately protect, share and publish data and
information in ways that support better services, and
to derive the best value from investments in data,
information and technology.
This policy forms part of the IM Framework.
Case studies
Progress is demonstrated by the following three
case studies.
Transport for NSW established the NSW transport data
exchange (TDX) program. Data is available in a range
of machine-readable, spatially enabled formats.
TDX provides real time data on:
•	 timetables, routes and stops
•	  here your train, bus, ferry or light rail service
w
is right now and estimated arrival times
•	 live traffic updates and incidents
•	 travel times
•	 scheduled road work.
NSW Government Open Data Policy
3NSW Government
Open Data Policy
Objectives Scope
The objectives of this policy are to assist NSW
Government agencies to: This policy applies to all NSW Government agencies
including cluster agencies, Departments, Statutory
Bodies and Shared Service Providers. In accordance
with Premier’s Memorandum M1999-19 Applicability of
Memoranda and Circulars to State Owned Corporations,
the Policy is not mandatory for State Owned
Corporations, although it is recommended for adoption.
NSW Government funded research data must also be
made open under this policy.
•	 r  elease data for use by the community, research,
business and industry
•	  ccelerate the use of data to derive new insights for
a
better public services
•	 embed open data into business-as-usual
•	  se data to inform the design of policy, programs
u
and procurement
•	 s  upport the use of data by the NSW Data Analytics
Centre for research and evidence-based
decision making
•	  dvance citizen engagement with government and
a
the work of government
•	 support the Government Information (Public Access)
Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA Act) and promote simple
and efficient compliance with the requirements set
out in that Act.
What is open data?
This policy focuses on datasets as an aspect of
information defined in the Government Information
(Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA Act).
A dataset is an identifiable collection of government
held information or data. Most commonly a dataset
corresponds to the contents of a single database table,
or a single statistical data matrix. The term can also be
used to refer to the data in a collection of closely related
tables. A dataset may comprise a smaller grouping
(or subset) of data which, though limited by some
constraint or feature type, is located physically within a
larger dataset.
Target audiences for this policy include government
agencies, non-government organisations (NGOs),
academia, industry (including ICT developers) and
members of the public who are interested in or have a
specific use for government data.
Open Data Principles
Open data principles lead to more responsive and
smarter government, and better service delivery.
To meet the obligations of this policy, agencies must
manage data as a strategic asset to be:
•	 Open by default, protected where required
•	 Prioritised, discoverable and usable
•	 Primary and timely
•	 Well managed, trusted and authoritative
•	 Free where appropriate
•	 Subject to public input.
Data is open to the extent that its management, release
and characteristics meet the principles of openness
outlined in this policy. Open data should be both
technically available and usable, and have licensing
frameworks in place to facilitate its release and use.

When procuring or upgrading systems according to
the ICT Investment Policy and Guidelines, agencies will
consider the use of technologies that enable data to
be consumed by other systems, without the need for
manual intervention.
Metadata allows datasets to be found, understood,

1JOHN CAIN FOUNDATION
The John Cain Foundation is an independent think tank, working on issues of importance to Victoria and
nationally.
John Cain served as Premier from 1982-1990 and remains the longest serving Labor Premier in Victoria. His
government was responsible for many signature reforms later taken up by other states.
The former Victorian Premier is widely seen as one of Australia’s most effective leaders and his name is
synonymous with integrity. His three terms of government modernised Victoria and raised standards for
transparency, fairness and integrity. These values are too easily lost or diminished in the current short-
term political cycle. It is the job of thinking commentators and thought leaders to reinstate the integrity of
political and social action.
The record of achievement of the Victorian government under the leadership of John Cain is our inspiration
to renew the spirit of social democracy in Australia today. 
The Foundation stands for:
•	 the courage of ideas
•	 a strong sustainable economy for the 21st century
•	 reward for innovation & enterprise
•	 fairness – opportunities for all
•	 strategic long-term thinking
•	 transparent accountable government
We are independent, but will work with partners with complementary values and ideas.
We welcome donations and participation in our events program.

3PREFACE
When the John Cain Foundation was considering the front cover for this paper we did not have to strain
hard for an arresting title or sub title. The reference to an “arms race in political donations” has its origin in a
phrase used by John Faulkner in the introduction to his 2008 Green Paper on electoral reform of donations
and funding.
As the newly installed Special Minister of State in the Rudd Government, Senator Faulkner was quick off
the mark in wanting to address some of the major challenges that threaten the health and integrity of our
democracy. His concerns ranged across inadequate disclosure laws, the influence of third party participants
and the potential for policy capture by big donors, the confusion and incoherence of nine different electoral
systems across the country, as well as the spiralling cost of electioneering.
Senator Faulkner explicitly stated in his report that, without change, Australia would fall behind world’s best
practice. He wrote -
“The choice before us is whether to seek to adapt ourselves, or to throw up our hands and
allow participants in the political system to do what they want. Given the importance of
political financing to the conduct of elections, the structure of our political system, and the
operation of political parties and other political actors, it is incumbent on governments to
engage with these questions, and to take active steps to ensure that our democracy evolves in
ways consistent with the expectations and requirements of citizens.”
Eight years on from this laudable call to arms, the John Cain Foundation, a body committed to a revival of
integrity in our political institutions, asks the obvious question – why has there been zero progress on a set
of changes that are desperately needed?
In a May 10 2016 editorial The Age also voiced its indignation on behalf of voters –
“It is altogether dispiriting that nothing has changed...in terms of transparency, accountability
and timeliness, the laws remain hopelessly inadequate.”
This research paper, commissioned by JCF and written by political scientist Adjunct Professor Colleen Lewis
(Monash University) has been produced with a view to stimulating voter support for a comprehensive
clean-up of our shambolic and inadequate donations laws.
With a lifetime of professional attention to the ways in which we can strength the pillars of Australian
democracy, Professor Lewis documents a quite shameful neglect by federal MPs, parliamentary
committees, and successive governments. To read her report is to be left wondering if there is any sense of
urgency or policy purpose left in Canberra. The revolving door of personnel is particularly instructive.
The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has managed to install and dispatch five chairpersons in
the space of one parliamentary year.
4We see the result in the almost daily revelations that suggest a cowboy culture of attempted vote-buying.
In 2016, depressingly, we seem to have arrived at precisely the point feared by Faulkner when he warned
of a system “where political players do what they like.” How else to explain the utter sangfroid whereby
the Liberal/Labor duopoly regularly hold fundraisers and conferences where ‘special access’ is provided
with a large dollar figure attached for the privileged few? Or worse, the $20 million that Clive Palmer’s PUP
party managed to spend at the last election? The list of egregious behaviour involves everything from
union slush funds, attempts to game the system in NSW to avoid the ban on money from developers, and
perhaps the most jaw-dropping of all – Tony Abbott’s belated admission that, as a younger MP, a well-
known millionaire handed him $5000 in cash as a Christmas present.
It is unsurprising then to see that our trust in politicians and in our institutions is at a record low. Others
are watching. Transparency International ranks Australia poorly when it comes to key measures on
their Corruption Index. We have fallen six places since 2012 and are now ranked at no 13 against other
democracies. What stands out when we are compared with others is that our fragmented approach to
political donations escalates “the risk of corruption.”
This should be a red light issue for all MPs and candidates seeking election in 2016. As a former Labor
MP, and one whose 2007 campaign attracted generous levels of financing, I have huge respect for those
who put their hand up to be part of the representative political process. It was the hardest job I ever did
and most of the people I encountered in the national parliament were conscientious, energetic and public
spirited. Most MPs I spent time with admitted that they can’t stand the whole business of fund-raising and
rattling the tin on behalf of their parties. Equally, few can say they have had no exposure to the potentially
corrosive effect of money and politics – either at the periphery or substantially.
We can change this. It will require a serious commitment by our leaders and from all MPs. It starts with the
next commonwealth parliament- whatever its make-up.
The measure of leadership and commitment to democratic accountability should be judged against the
following criteria: implementation of uniform national laws, caps on donations, a ceiling on public and
private expenditure, and timely disclosure.
Australian Electoral Commission records estimate the total cost of the last 2013 federal poll – the cost to
run it, as well as payments to candidates – as close to $200 million. It’s harder to put an accurate figure on
the total expenditure of the political parties, unions and other interest groups but the available information
suggests that $20 million was spent on advertising.
With an eight week campaign and ever increasing advertising budgets, who doubts that the figure for
2016 will be even higher? The rules, such as they are, that govern this donations arms race, are no longer
adequate or defensible.
That is the rationale for the John Cain Foundation call for a Come Clean election. We urge you all to be a
part of this project and help restore a measure of trust to Australian democracy.

6EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Australians have been let down by their political leaders, other members of parliament (MPs) and by the
federal parliamentary committee system. This harsh assessment is the result of research into political
donations laws in this country.
In 2008, a 99-page Electoral Reform Green Paper: Donations, Funding and Expenditure was circulated by
the then Special Minister of State, Senator John Faulkner in the hope it would ‘open debate and lead to the
implementation of reforms that will ensure the Australian electoral system is world’s best practice’. It did
not.
In 2011, dedicated parliamentary research staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters
(JSCEM) wrote a comprehensive 268-page Report on the Funding of Political Parties and Election
Campaigns for consideration and debate by members of the Committee, the parliament and, through
parliamentary processes, the people.
Learned experts gave freely of their time and considerable knowledge in the form of written submissions
to the JSCEM. They also agreed to appear before Committee hearings in person. They were not alone;
several institutions made written submissions and appeared before the Committee. There was also input
from some MPs and members of the public. A key stakeholder, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC),
made multiple submissions and appeared before the JSCEM on several occasions.
The JSCEM report summarized, in a highly readable fashion, key features of the current scheme and
proposed a set of reforms. Thirty well-considered recommendations were made under the following
headings: private funding; options for private funding reform; expenditure; public funding; third parties
and associated entities; compliance; and other issues.
To date there is little, some might say nothing, to show for the money taxpayers have, knowingly or
unknowingly, invested into reforming the funding of federal politics in Australia. Indeed the return on
investment over the past eight years is zero. As the AEC points out, ‘No legislation relating to political
donations and funding has been enacted by [the Federal Parliament] since 2008’. If any private institution
had this type of return on their research and development budget they would, by now, have gone out of
business.
The failure of the Australian Government to enact any reform, and for such a long period of time, indicates
successive governments’ complete disdain for the committee process. It also shows a concerning level of
disrespect toward all those who contributed their time and expertise to the process.
But the story gets worse. The JSCEM has had five chairpersons in the past 12 months (2015-2016), with
some holding the position for only a matter of weeks. This is an appalling response to reforming political
donations laws at the federal level.
Equally scandalous is the relegation of this crucially important topic to a Council of Australian
Governments’ (COAG) dinner, held the evening before the recent 1 April 2016 COAG meeting. Clearly
political donations laws are not considered important enough to be placed on COAG’s formal agenda. This
decision by Australia’s state, territory and federal leaders lets the Australian public know, in no uncertain
terms, the priority placed on political donations policy by those with the power to reform the system.
7There is no doubt that the existing disparate arrangement, comprising nine different sets of laws, which
reflect the priorities of each political jurisdiction, needs fixing. What is required, and quickly, is a national
approach to how politics in funded in this country. This will help prevent members of parliament and the
political parties to which most belong manipulating the federated system.
While there are examples of Labor members of parliament and the Labor Party abusing political donations
laws, the somewhat recent revelations from the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)
in New South Wales (NSW) into the highly unethical conduct of Liberal Party MPs, the Liberal Party and
its federal fund raising arm, the Free Enterprise Foundation, exemplifies how inconsistent state and
federal laws can be manipulated for personal and party interests. This example offers a text book case
of parliamentarians disregarding their fiduciary duty to the public office-public trust principle, which
necessitates that the public interest be placed before personal and party considerations at all times.
While a national approach is required, on its own it is not sufficient, as the danger exists that Australia’s
political leaders could decide to adopt the lowest common denominator option. To guard against this
possibility, reform is also required to the key drivers (the component parts) that would form the framework
of a national system. All of Australia’s nine political jurisdictions and other parliamentary democracies
consider these issues when shaping their political donations regime.
They include:
•	 bans on donations;
•	 caps on donations;
•	 disclosure threshold;
•	 sanctions for not complying with the law;
•	 public funding;
•	 private funding; and
•	 a ceiling on the cost of election campaigns.
Those devising a national approach will have to come to a consensus on what category of donors should
be banned, or whether capping all donations to a modest level alleviates the need for bans. Modest in this
context being determined by the amount ‘ordinary’ voters could reasonably afford to donate to a candidate
or political party. Sums ranging between $500 and $1500 are often nominated.
Decisions are also required on disclosure laws, including the gap that unnecessarily exists between the
receipt of donations and the electorate being made aware of who donated to whom and by how much.
Political leaders must be aware that this information is necessary prior to votes being cast. Without it, the
architects of the current system are forcing voters to make an uninformed decision.
Public money, the amount taxpayer should contribute to election campaigns, is another key determinate,
as is private funding. In terms of the latter, the issues that need to be addressed revolve around ‘policy
capture’ and ‘policies for sale’. A ruling is also required on whether paying to have privileged access to a
prime minister, premier, minister and other political leaders, and for some hours, honours the public office-
public trust principle.
8Another important decision relates to the total amount of funding that should be expended on election
campaigns. As far back as 2008, former Special Minister of State, John Faulkner alerted his parliamentary
colleagues of the need to do something to curb overall spending on electoral matters. Failure to do so, he
explained, would increase the pressure on political parties and candidates to intensify their fundraising
efforts. Such pressure, Faulkner warned, could ‘open the door’ to donors who might try to purchase ‘access
and influence’. It seems that Faulkner’s warning has fallen on deaf ears.
This paper makes it abundantly clear that the current state of political donations laws in Australia needs
urgent attention. Reform is long overdue and the only thing that seems to be standing in its way is
personal and party interests. They should no longer be allowed to take precedence over the public interest.
Taxpayers’ lack of trust in MPs and the political process is understandable when they are expected to
invest in endless research and development that achieves no outcome. They deserve better than this. The
electorate and broader community are entitled to action and that action must result in a national funding
regime that all Australians can be proud of, rather than one they shun. The current disparate arrangement
fails the public interest (and pub) test.
9OPTIONS FOR FUNDING
POLITICS IN AUSTRALIA
OPTION 1
ADOPT A UNIFORM, NATIONAL APPROACH TO HOW POLITICS IS FUNDED IN AUSTRALIA.
This option would include: a ban on certain people, groups and institutions making political donations and/
or placing modest caps on all forms of donations; implementing real-time disclosure; and placing a ceiling
on the amount of private and public monies that can be spent on electoral campaigns.
Because Australia is a federation, it is common for there to be nine distinct sets of laws for many areas of
public policy. But some issues transcend a federated arrangement; they require a national approach.
How politics is funded in this country is one of those issues. At stake is people’s trust in Australia’s
democratic political system and its members of parliament.
Transparency International (Australia) recently recommended that this country move to a national political
donations system and the highly respected Schott Inquiry into political donations in New South Wales
proposed that the premier place on the Council of Australian Governments’ agenda the issue of how
politics is funded in Australia. Despite Premier Baird’s efforts to act on the Inquiry’s recommendation, he
has failed to convince other political leaders that the issue is worthy of serious discussion.
Political leaders seem incapable of coming together to even examine, in a serious way, this crucial issue.
They will not do so unless forced to act by the electorate and media.
Political donations laws need to be placed firmly on the political agenda in the forthcoming federal election
and at every state and territory election, until such times as political leaders agree to publicly discuss
introducing a national approach to how politics is financed, or alternatively to defend the status quo on the
basis that it is in the public interest.
Moving speedily to introduce Option 1 is in the best interest of the nation’s political system, its people
and its members of parliament. If political leaders can demonstrate, through their actions not words, a
preparedness to abide by the fiduciary duty they owe to those who elect them to office, they will be taking
the all-important first step to honouring the public office-public trust principle. Through such action, the
public interest will be given its rightful place, which is before personal and party interests.
Implementation of this option is clearly in the public interest and therefore should be adopted speedily by
all of Australia’s political leaders and supported by other members of parliaments. To do otherwise will see
the public interest languishing in the same neglected position it has occupied for far too long.
10OPTION 2
MOVE QUICKLY TO REFORM EXISTING POLITICAL DONATIONS LAWS IN EACH STATE, TERRITORY
AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, BUT DO SO SEPARATELY.
Reform to political donations laws is badly needed in most Australian states, territories and at the federal
level. Even if each of Australia’s nine jurisdictions acted swiftly to reform their current systems, it is highly
unlikely, indeed improbable, they would do so simultaneously and in consultation with other jurisdictions.
While some reform is better than no reform, the outcome could only, at best, deliver an improved version
of the current, disparate approach to political donations laws.
This option offers no guarantee that members of parliament and political parties would not take
advantage of loopholes in a federated system.
Option 2 is rejected because, as past practices have demonstrated, it results in personal and party interests
being placed well before the public interest.
11PART A
ANALYSIS OF AUSTRALIA’S POLITICAL DONATION LAWS
12INTRODUCTION
1
When devising public policy, governments are often confronted by complex, seemingly unsolvable
‘wicked problems’ (Churchman 1967; Rittel & Webber 1973). Such problems sit at one end of the public
policy spectrum. At the other end are issues that can be classified as self-evident, or to use a colloquial
term, ‘no brainers’. This conversational expression encapsulates the reality that solutions to some policy
matters are so clearly in the public interest that they should proceed quickly from policy formulation to
implementation. Reforming Australia’s political donations laws and adopting a national approach to the
ways politics is funded in this country sits on the self-evident end of the spectrum.
To support this proposition, political funding regulations in each of the Australian states and territories and
at the federal level are discussed. There are nine separate jurisdictions, and nine distinct sets of laws that
when looked at together are disjointed and inconsistent. 2
When evaluating Australia’s fragmented approach to financing politics, 3 the paper examines key drivers
that shape the funding of politics. They include: who (if anyone) should be banned from making donations;
caps on donations; disclosure thresholds; and penalties for breaching political funding laws. This
information offers a handy snapshot of the status quo.
The paper also discusses the issue of private funding donated to candidates and political parties by
individuals, corporations, trade unions, third party donors 4 and associated entities 5 as well as the public
monies paid by Australian taxpayers to partially cover the cost of election campaigns. A central issue for
private funding is whether uncapped donations and/or those not subject to disclosure thresholds result
in a class of donor afforded privileged access to decision-makers, and whether this in turn leads to ‘policy
capture’ (OECD 2016). In relation to public funding the debate centres on whether taxpayers should be
expected to fund electoral campaigns and if so, by how much.
In 2008, then Special Minister of State, John Faulkner suggested in the Electoral Reform Green Paper:
Donations, Funding and Expenditure that Australia is experiencing an escalating ‘arms race’ in the lead
up to elections, with the greatest beneficiaries perhaps being advertising firms and the media (radio,
television, newspapers and online news sites). The rising cost associated with elections has been also
examined by Gray and Jones (2010) and Young and Tham (2006) and is examined in this paper with view to
canvassing what might be done about it.

3	 The terms political donations, funding politics and financing politics are used inter-changeably in this paper.
4	 Third party donors are defined as ‘individuals or organisations that incur “political expenditure” but who are not seeking election’ (Faulkner 2008, p.86).

An associated entity is ‘an entity that is controlled by a “registered political party”, that operates wholly or to a significant extent for the benefit of a registered political
party, that is, or on whose behalf another person is, a financial member of a registered political party, that hold, on whose behalf another person holds, voting rights in a
registered political party’ (Faulkner 2008, p.85).
13The paper also suggests options for the Australian electorate and political leaders to consider when
determining if the current system, based on nine separate sets of laws, is in the public interest.
It draws on a series of comprehensive reports by respected international institutions and, in the Australian
context, on papers, reports (interim and final), submissions to parliamentary committees and to inquiries,
discussions by panels of experts, working papers, media reports and academic articles. Many of them have
broached the subject of Australia adopting a national approach to political donations. For example, in a
position paper by Transparency International Australia (2016), attention is drawn to the fact that:
The risks of corruption are heightened by inconsistencies in Commonwealth and State
legislation relating to electoral finance disclosure and lobbying (p.1).
The paper addresses evidence from the New South Wales’ Independent Commission Against Corruption,
which lay bare how a political party and some of its parliamentary members in NSW manipulated the
current patchwork approach to political funding for their personal advantage and that of their party. A
national approach, it is argued, would help to plug the gap unashamedly exploited by the Federal Liberal
Party to circumvent NSW laws pertaining to political donations.
The Liberal Party and Liberal MPs are not the only ones to have abused political donations laws. The paper
also refers to evidence given by the current leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, Bill Shorten,
to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption (Commonwealth of Australia
2015) (The Heydon Royal Commission) and from the West Australian Royal Commission into Commercial
Activities of Government (Government of Western Australia 1992) (commonly referred to as the WA Inc.
Royal Commission). The latter exposed scandals involving former Labor Party Premier, Brian Burke.
Before moving on, it is necessary to say something about the structure of the paper, which the reader will
see is divided into two equally important parts. Part B concerns the rules and regulations that make up
key elements of political donations laws across Australia’s states, territories and at the federal level. This
information is crucial to understanding the narrative style discussion and arguments put forward in Part A.
The decision to divide the paper was reached after writing several drafts that tried unsuccessfully to blend
the information contained in Part A and Part B. The problem was the loss of detail that occurred when
précising the rules and regulations outlined in Part B.
NOT ANOTHER DUST CATCHER
The John Cain Foundation and the author do not want this research paper to suffer the same fate as the
many excellent papers, reports and submissions to green papers, parliamentary committees and inquiries
into political donations that have gone before it. They are gathering dust on library shelves, victims of
political inaction.
In an attempt to avoid this fate, individual members of parliament, political leaders and political parties in all
nine jurisdictions are being called on to publicly justify why they continue to retain the current approach to
political funding laws. To support their explanation, they need to supply strong evidence that demonstrates
to the electorate how nine distinct regimes are in Australia’s collective (public) interest. One can only
assume that the majority of MPs and political parties believe it is, as successive state, territory and federal
governments have failed to come together to discuss seriously this key public policy matter.
14Should today’s political leaders express their support for a national approach to the way politics is financed,
they must give the electorate a very firm date that sets down precisely when they will clear the way for
the introduction of a national system. The Premier of New South Wales, Mike Baird, raised the matter at
the last two COAG meetings. In doing so, he was responding to Recommendation 2 of the Schott Inquiry’s
Political Donations Final Report – Volume 1 (Schott, Tink & Watkins 2014a), which states:
That the Premier support co-ordinated national reform of election funding laws, and seek to
put the issue on the COAG agenda (p.11).
Regrettably, his suggestion that government leaders examine, in a meaningful way, the fractured state
of political funding laws and move to a national regime failed to attract the interest of other political
leaders. Indeed, the issue did not even make it on to the official COAG agenda. Instead it was relegated
to a mention at a leaders’ dinner held the night before the actual COAG meeting (Nicholls 2015; 2016).
The electorate is owed a full explanation as to why this was the case. A crowded COAG agenda is not a
satisfactory reason. There are very few public policy matters that are more important to the health of our
democratic system than how politics is funded. After all, nearly every other public policy decision is directly
or indirectly tied to it.
Before moving on to discuss the issues outlined above, it is important to ‘set the scene’ for the remainder
of the paper. This is done in two stages. The first outlines the paper’s framework: the public interest and
public office-public trust nexus. All other issues reside within that framework.
The second is to bring to the attention of the electorate and media what can only be described as the
absurd process that has accompanied attempts by some, including current and former MPs, to reform
Australia’s political donation regime at the federal level and to consider a unified national system. If the
saga surrounding the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, outlined below, typifies the best
the Australian electorate can expect from its parliamentary committee system and governments, then
Australia’s democracy is in serious trouble. This chain of events also highlights a process that must never
be repeated.
THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND PUBLIC OFFICE-PUBLIC TRUST NEXUS
The central argument of this paper rests within the public interest and public office-public trust principle.
These two concepts are inter-twined, but the least referred to and perhaps least well known of the two
is the public office-public trust. It is not a concept that comes up in day-to-day conversation, and is rarely
used by the media or referred to by members of parliament when explaining the rationale behind policy
decisions. Nevertheless, it is central to making sense of the oft quoted but somewhat imprecise term, the
public interest.
The author is aware that using long quotes, and too many of them, is not the best way to hold readers’
attention. It is necessary, however, to do so here, as the opinions are from learned people who set out
clearly the nature and importance of fiduciary relationships, which are at the heart of the public interest
and public office-public trust nexus
15The concept of a fiduciary relationship is the key to understanding what is meant in practice by the public
office-public trust principle. A fiduciary relationship is a legal term that refers to obligations on a person that
arise as a result of a relationship with another person or persons. In trying to explain how honouring one’s
fiduciary duty goes to the core of relations between members of parliament and those who elect them
to power, this section of the paper relies heavily on a presentation by the Hon. Roger Macknay QC (2012)
to the 18th Annual Public Sector Fraud and Corruption Conference and the presentation of the Hon. Tim
Smith QC, to the University of Melbourne’s School of Government in December 2015.
Macknay, when discussing what is meant by the term fiduciary, explains that even though a generally
accepted definition of the concept has ‘proven elusive’ there are normally elements of trust, confidence,
reliance or vulnerability in the relationship. As he says:
The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty, which includes that
a fiduciary must act in good faith and must not benefit from a conflict between personal
interest and the fiduciary duty (p.1).
The principles outlined in the following judgement (referred to by Macknay) are particularly instructive and
help to highlight the strong link between the public interest and the public office-public trust principle. It
also explains why adherence to this principle by MPs is central to restoring people’s faith in democracy,
which is severely weakened by opaque financing and donations laws.
Referring to the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters
(Government of Western Australia 1992) and its second report tabled in November 1992, Macknay (2012)
explains that when the Commission laid down what should be the minimum standard of conduct for
public officials (elected and appointed) it referred to and ‘set considerable store’ on a 1952 decision of the
Supreme Court of New Jersey, which explained that:
[Public officers] stand in a fiduciary relationship (that is a relationship of trust) to the people
who they have been elected ... to serve ... As fiduciaries and trustees of the public weal they
are under an obligation to serve the public with the highest fidelity. In discharging the duties
of their office, they are required to ... exercise their discretion not arbitrarily but reasonably,
and above all to display good faith, honesty and integrity ... They must be impervious to
corrupting influences and they must transact their business frankly and openly in the light
of public scrutiny so that the public may know and be able to judge them and their work
fairly. When public officials do not so conduct themselves ... their actions are inimical to and
inconsistent with the public interest.
These obligations are not mere theoretical concepts or idealistic abstractions of no practical
force or effect ... the enforcement of these obligations is essential to the soundness and
efficiency of our government, which exists for the benefit of the people (pp.3-4).
16Another learned judgement, this time by Lord Bingham in the House of Lords (also cited by Macknay 2012)
helps to clarify why the public office-public trust principle should guide all decisions made by the people’s
representatives. As Bingham (in Macknay 2012) made clear:
It follows from the proposition that public powers are conferred as if upon trust that those
who exercise powers in a manner inconsistent with the public purpose for which the powers
are conferred betray that trust and so misconduct themselves. This is an old and very
important principle (p.12).
When the Hon. Tim Smith QC (2015) examined the importance of what he describes as the public office-
public trust principle, he referred to the attempt by the Hon. Tony Fitzgerald QC AC to have Queensland
politicians promise to abide by a series of commitments prior to the last state election. They included that
those seeking election:
Make all decisions and take all actions ... in the public interest without regard to personal,
party political or other immaterial considerations;
Treat all people equally without permitting any person or corporation special access or
influence; and
Promptly and accurately inform the public of its reasons for all significant or potentially
controversial decisions and actions (p.1).
Smith (2015) commented that these individual principles:
Give effect to, and are supported by, one fundamental principle that should guide all the
participants in our democracies – those holding public office, those assisting them and we
the people. The principle is the “public office public trust principle” [which] requires that
when making decisions they must put the public interest first and in priority to their personal
interests and other private interests (p.2).
In making his argument Smith (2015) also referred to a presentation by Sir Gerard Brennan, former chief
justice of the High Court, in which Sir Gerard explained:
The motivation for political action is often complex – but that does not negate the fiduciary
nature of political duty. Power, whether legislative or executive, is reposed in members of the
Parliament by the public for exercise in the interests of the public and not primarily for the
interests of members or the parties to which they belong. The cry “whatever it takes” is not
consistent with the performance of fiduciary duty (p.2).
17To return to Macknay (2012, p.4), he notes that in Australia the notion of a fiduciary relationship between
MPs and those they represent was applied in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but then slipped
into ‘virtual obscurity’ for a period of time. A growing lack of confidence in public sector institutions, and
the political process more generally has led to a renewed focus on the public office-public trust principle
(Macknay 2012, p.12). It is a principle that the electorate must hold members of parliament to before,
during and after election to office, and particularly so in relation to Australia’s political donation laws as they
are critical to the integrity of Australia’s political system.
SOME MIGHT CALL IT A DISGRACE
In December 2008, Senator John Faulkner published the thoughtful Green Paper referred to earlier. This
was written and widely distributed in an attempt to raise people’s awareness of the issues surrounding
political funding in Australia and to have the matter discussed by the broader community, members of
parliament and political parties, with a view to moving toward a more open, transparent and accountable
national system.
Some two-and-a-half years later, on 11 May 2011, the Australian Senate requested that the Joint Standing
Committee on Electoral Matters inquire into:
Options to improve the system for the funding of political parties and election campaigns
with particular reference to:
•	 Issues raised in the Government’s Electoral Reform Green Paper – Donations,
Funding and Expenditure, released in December 2008;
•	 The role of third parties in the electoral process;
•	 The transparency and accountability of the funding regime;
•	 Limiting the escalating cost of elections;
•	 Any relevant measures at the state and territory level and implications for the
Commonwealth; and
•	 The international practices for the funding of political parties and election
campaigns, including in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the
United States of America.
18The Committee’s well-researched 268-page report was tabled in parliament in early December 2011.
The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP, the Hon. Alex Somlyay MP, Senator Scott Ryan, Mr Dan Tehan MP and Mr
Darren Chester MP, all from the Liberal-National Coalition, issued a dissenting 13-page report. 6 Senator Lee
Rhiannon on behalf of the Australian Greens tabled an eight-page dissenting report. 7
The Committee, chaired by Labor’s Daryl Melham, received 37 submissions from 26 people/institutions;
nine exhibits, held seven hearings (five in Canberra and one each in Sydney and Melbourne) and heard
evidence from 24 people. 8 The Executive Summary included a very useful overview, in table form, which
compared the current scheme with the proposed approach. This was followed by 30 recommendations
that would, if implemented, have reformed political funding at the federal level and perhaps nudged
Australia toward a national political donations system that takes much greater account of the public
interest than does the country’s present mismatched approach.
WILFUL NEGLECT
Since then, no action has been taken by governments on either side of the political divide in response to
this comprehensive report. Taxpayers’ money was wasted on achieving no outcome.
On 15 October 2015, the Senate referred an inquiry into political donations to the JSCEM, the same
committee that had written the 268-page report some four years earlier. It was asked to inquire into
(among other things):
How many of the recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral
Matters in its 2011 report ... into the funding of political parties and election campaigns were
accepted by Government and how many have been implemented?
What factors, if any, are contributing to any delays in implementing the accepted
recommendations of the report?
6	
The Liberal-National Coalition members expressed the view that the majority of the Committee’s recommendations were ‘solely to serve the interests of the Australian
Labor Party, the Greens, and their backers such as Get Up’. They specifically opposed:
‘Changing the donations disclosure threshold; it should remain at its current level of $11,900, which is indexed.
Donations to “related political parties” being treated as a donation to the same party.
Altering the definition of “gift” to include attendance at fundraisers.
Moving to six-monthly disclosure for political parties.
Investigating options to introduce a system of expenditure caps’ (2011, p.229)
7	
Senator Rhiannon’s dissenting report argued that the recommendations in the JSCEM Report did not go far enough. She put forward 13 suggestions based on the
Green’s desire to have Australian elections ‘funded through a combination of public funding and small donations from individuals’. She also proposed ‘speedy and
transparent public disclosure of donations so that voters would know the source of all donations to political parties. To achieve these ends her report recommended:
‘A ban on all donations from all entities other than individuals.
A cap on the amount of money that can be donated in a year from a single individual to a political party or candidates.
Caps on expenditure by political parties, candidates and third parties.
Adequate public funding for political parties, including both funding for election campaigning and for other administrative work of the party, with funding based on the
percentage of the vote received by each party. Continuous disclosure of all political donations above $100, within two weeks of all donations being made’.
Looking to long-term solutions the Greens also recommended that Australia move to full public funding of elections (p.236).
8	
Other members of the Committee were The Hon Bronwyn Bishop MP; Mr Darren Chester MP (from 2/6/11); The Hon Allan Griffin MP; Ms Amanda Rishworth MP; Mr
Dan Tehan MP (from 2/6/11); Mr Tony Windsor MP (from 25/5/11); Senator Bob Brown (to 5/7/11); Senator Carol Brown; Senator Helen Polley; Senator Lee Rhiannon
(from 5/7/11); and Senator Scott Ryan.
19In response to this direction, the JSCEM wrote to the government and on 3 December 2015 the government
presented to parliament (in the Speaker’s schedule of outstanding responses) the following advice:
... given the passage of time and the change of government, the Government does not intend
to respond to the report.
This is an unacceptable - some might think disgraceful - response to a key public policy matter. The issue
has dragged on for approximately eight years and the cost to taxpayers extends beyond the JSCEM’s work.
For example, the AEC submitted five submissions to the 2011 JSCEM Inquiry, which gave a ‘comprehensive
overview’ of funding and disclosure structures, and AEC staff appeared at three public hearings, all to no
avail. As the AEC (2016) noted in its Submission to the Inquiry into Political Donations:
No legislation relating to political donations and funding has been enacted by [the federal]
Parliament since 2008 (p.9).
The above saga highlights the wilfully neglectful approach by governments and parliaments to political
donations reform at the federal level.
But wait, there is more.
The JSCEM has had five (5), yes five chairpersons, in the past 12 months.
•	 Mr Tony Smith MP, 9-9-2014 - 21-8-15
•	 Mr Alex Hawke MP, 9-9-15 - 12.10.15
•	 Mrs Jane Prentice MP, 14-10-15 - 22-2-16
•	 Mr David Coleman MP, 22-2-16 - 2-3-16
•	 Mr Scott Buchholz MP, 15-3-16 - present.
This rapid turnover of chairpersons is an inexcusable approach to policy formulation, implementation
and evaluation. It is best described as a farcical response to examining, among other things, how politics
is funded in Australia and what reforms are required to ensure that the public interest becomes the
foundation and framework for all future action by governments, members of parliament and political
parties.
20THE ‘INCONSISTENT’ STATUS QUO
Transparency International Australia, in its 2016 position paper Political Finance and Donations, makes
clear that Australia’s fragmented, ‘inconsistent’ approach to political donations escalates ‘the risk of
corruption’. This highly-regarded organisation argues that ‘there is a need for national consistency’. It
points to the ‘opportunity’ the Australian Government has to take a leadership position in ‘the search
for national best practice’, which includes replacing the current ‘piecemeal arrangements’ with a unified
approach. As evidenced by the chain of events surrounding the JSCEM’s 2011 report, referred to above, the
Federal Government is showing no interest in reforming the federal political donations regime, let alone
spearheading a move that would see the speedy introduction of a best practice, national model.
The Australian Government should publicly support the Transparency International recommendation and
do so in the lead up to the forthcoming federal election, as should the Australian Labor Party, all minor
parties, networks and independents. If they fail to do so, political leaders from the states and territories
need to recall their fiduciary duty to the electorate (and broader community) to honour the public office-
public trust principle. Doing so will ensure that their decision is motivated by the public interest, thereby
transcending all other interests.
Highly respected senior public servant, Dr Kerry Schott, chaired an inquiry into political donations in NSW.
Other members of the ‘Panel of Experts’ were Mr Andrew Tink AM and the Hon. John Watkins. Their
report, commonly referred to as the Schott Report (2014a), did not make a direct recommendation that
Australia move toward a national set of laws to regulate political donations. This is understandable as the
inquiry was focused on New South Wales. Hence, such a recommendation would be beyond the scope of
the inquiry and the power of any NSW government to implement. The Report on the Funding of Political
Parties and Election Campaigns (JSCEM 2011) had also canvassed the issue (pp.199-206) and in doing
so referred to submissions made to the 2008 Green Paper by Professor Anne Twomey, a constitutional
law academic and expert in the political donations area, and former senator for Western Australia,
Andrew Murray. Importantly though, the JSCEM (2011) report noted that ‘harmonising political financing
arrangements’ between Australia’s nine political jurisdictions ‘should be a goal of reforms in this area’
(p.206). As the JSCEM report had pointed out:
A single national funding and disclosure system with a single administering body could help
to address concerns about confusion; the administrative burden on individuals, political
parties and other groups with reporting obligations and federalism issues (p.199).
Twomey (2011) had also commented, prophetically as it turns out, that:
... a uniform approach to political donations would be more effective in addressing some
of the potential for circumventing requirements that exists when different systems are
operating at the federal and state government levels because if you impose limitations at
one level and they do not exist at the other, the money comes in though the back door and
the regulation tends to be ineffective (p.199-200).
She supported the idea of a national system, saying it would be desirable (p.200).
21Andrew Murray (2011, p.199) highlighted the savings that would arise from a national approach.
He explained that ‘savings and efficiencies’ would arise from having ‘one rather than nine electoral
commissions’. Other savings, he noted, would apply to ‘participants and for funding and expenditure’.
Murray acknowledged that the decision to move to a national system would have to be made by Australia’s
nine political jurisdictions, but went on to argue that:
The conduct for elections, the regulation of political participants and funding and
expenditure ... all should be national (p.202).
Murray also suggested the adoption of a national scheme should be put to COAG. As highlighted
previously, however, it is proving extremely difficult to get the matter listed on the COAG agenda.
There is no denying that getting agreement on a national scheme will require higher-order negotiation
skills and a willingness by all political leaders to compromise. But surely our elected representatives are
capable of rising to the challenge of placing the national public interest before personal, party and state and
territory interests, especially on such a fundamental democratic issue as political donations. Such conduct
is not an unreasonable ask or impossible task for our political leaders and other members of parliaments –
or is it? One hopes not, for as Premier Baird has made clear, the current suite of inconsistent laws ‘creates
opportunity for avoidance and potentially undermines any state system’ (Nicholls 2015).
FIXING THE COMPONENT PARTS
This paper now discusses issues underpinning key drivers that shape political donations laws in Australia
and in other democracies. To remind the reader, these factors include: banned donors; caps on donations;
disclosure thresholds; penalties for not abiding by electoral laws; public funding of election campaigns; and
issues surrounding private funding. As will become clearer from reading (Part B), these drivers form the
framework of political donations laws in each of Australia’s nine political regimes, but what sits within that
framework is often vastly different.
The discussion on the component parts, coupled with the information provided in Part B, supports the case
for a national approach to political funding. It also supports the view expressed by respected experts in the
area, Professors Joo-Cheong Tham and Graeme Orr (2011, p.2) that Australia has a somewhat ‘laissez-faire’
approach to funding politics. This needs to change.
Given the attitude to reforming political donations laws displayed by political leaders at the recent COAG
dinner, it is unlikely that these same leaders will embrace change. If that proves to be the case, this paper
will at least give the electorate a snapshot of the status quo and a very useful basis on which to evaluate
arguments put forward by any political leader or MP supporting the current arrangement.
22The author may, however, be doing Australia’s political leaders and other MPs a disservice by
underestimating exactly where they place the public interest in terms of political donations reform. If that
is the case, she strongly recommends that the 2008 Green Paper, the 2011 JSCEM report and, in particular,
the Schott Inquiry’s Final Report (Schott et al 2014a), and the associated material that informs it (including
Schott et al 2014b; 2014c; 2014d; 2014e; Twomey 2014), be used as the foundation for arriving at decisions
that will mould a national system. All of these reports canvass similar issues and do so in a comprehensive
and thoughtful manner. The Schott Report is emphasised because of its extraordinary depth and breadth
of research and level of analysis that accompanies it. 9 It is also the most recent report, having been
published in 2014. While it focuses on NSW, all of the substantive arguments it canvasses can be applied to
other political jurisdictions.
Another reason for suggesting that these reports be used to inform a national model is to avoid
unnecessary repetition; a delaying tactic often used by governments wishing to maintain the status quo for
as long as possible. Using these reports will not only save time, it will also save taxpayers’ money.
BANNING SOME DONORS
In the majority of Australia’s nine political jurisdictions, any person, corporation, trade union, third party
donor and associated entity can donate to a political party or candidate. Only two states - New South Wales
and Queensland - disallow certain categories of donors, with NSW being the most restrictive. Refer to Part
B of this paper for further details.
The Schott Inquiry, in its Political Donations Final Report Volume 1, (2014a pp.3; & 33-41) canvassed placing
a total ban on all donations from private and other sources. It was responding to the suggestion that
restoring public trust in NSW’s political system could only be achieved by banning all donations.
The panel (Schott et al 2014a) rejected this idea, noting the ‘practical difficulties’ involved in such an
approach. Perhaps the most compelling reason put forward was that a total ban would mean:
Public funds would have to be provided to all those who seek to contest elections or
contribute to public debate, including new parties and third-party campaigners. Clearly it
would not be feasible for the State to fund every prospective candidate or third party (p.3).
Another reason for not accepting the suggestion was that it would breach the implied freedom to political
communication in the Australian Constitution, because modest donations allow people to express their
political voice (p.3). The panel came to the conclusion that:
A total ban ... would not be feasible, or constitutional or in the public interest (p.3).
Even though it discards the idea of a total ban, the Schott Panel (Schott et al 2014a) supported retaining
existing bans. These concern anonymous donations of $1000 or more, donations from the tobacco, liquor
and gambling industry, property developers and foreign sources (pp.42-50).
9 The information published by the Schott Panel of Experts includes transcripts of panel discussions by leading experts in the field, several working papers based on a series
of panel discussions and an interim report, as well as the more commonly used material gathered by inquiries and committees to inform their recommendations.
23The reason for banning particular donors is something that the International Institute for Democracy and
Electoral Assistance (IDEA) explored in its extensive 2014 report, Funding of Political Parties and Election
Campaigns: A Handbook on Political Finance. As it explains, the purpose of banning in some instances is to
‘completely stop contributions that are seen as particularly damaging to the democratic process’ (p.21). 10
As shown in Part B, the majority of Australia’s nine political jurisdictions do not ban donations from
particular categories of donors. When they do, they usually target corporations rather than organisations
with sufficient power to influence policy outcomes. If it proves difficult to reach agreement about who
should and should not be banned from making a political donation, another way of tackling undue
influence is through the capping of donations.
CAPS ON DONATIONS
As with other factors shaping key elements of political donations systems in Australia, there is no
consistency in terms of the level at which donations are capped.11 Caps on donations do not apply at
the federal level or in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia or the Australian Capital
Territory and Northern Territory. There are caps on donations in New South Wales and Victoria. It seems
that many governments adopt the same approach to caps as they do to bans: they favour the default
position of not restricting.
The capping of donations was canvassed in the 2008 Electoral Reform Green Paper (see Faulkner 2008,
pp.60-70) and in the JSCEM’s 2011 Report on the Funding of Political Parties and Election Campaigns (pp.71-
89). It is also discussed in the Final Report - Volume 1 of the Schott Report (2014a, pp.51-57).
Schott et al (2014a, p.51) explain that caps are imposed to address perceptions of corruption and undue
influence and to reduce the real risk of corruption. To achieve these outcomes it is necessary to restrict
donations to the level of what the politically engaged ‘ordinary’ voter can afford. Capping to a modest
amount, say $1000, allows the rich and less affluent to show their support for a candidate or party without
placing at risk ‘the integrity of government decision’. It also addresses the implied freedom of political
communication issue discussed in greater detail below.
The Schott Inquiry found widespread support for the use of caps although no consensus about the level at
which they should be set. After considering the various arguments put by experts in the political donations
area and by members of the public, the Inquiry (Schott et al 2014a) came to the conclusion that:
Caps are a measured and appropriate way of targeting large donations which clearly pose
the greatest risk in terms of corruption and undue influence (p.53).
10	
IDEA (2014, p.21) outlines the rationale for prohibiting donations from: foreign entities; corporations; public and-semi- public entities; trade unions; corporations with
government contracts; anonymous donors; and indirect donations. Refer to the report for further details.
11	
Caps extend beyond money; they also include in-kind contributions (‘indirect campaign contributions’) that include donations of office accommodation, motor vehicles,
computers, advertising and the waiving of advertising charges.
24DISCLOSURE: THE ESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY
The requirement to disclose publicly who has donated to a political campaign and how much they have
given is the foundation of any transparent and accountable political funding regime and is clearly in the
public interest. Not everyone, however, agrees. The Schott Inquiry heard arguments that the obligations
attached to disclosure requirements place an unreasonable administrative burden on those responsible
for disclosing. Those who do not favour disclosure also argue that being forced to disclose could dissuade
some potential donors from making a donation. ‘Fear of reprisals from friends, associates and the
community at large’ were given as reasons (Schott et al 2014a, p.96). A cap on donations that only allows
modest donations may well lessen that fear.
The JSCEM (2011) received a number of submissions that argued for more transparent disclosure laws.
Several reasons were given in support of this position, including:
A lower threshold would give electors a clearer idea of who was funding political parties and
the potential to which a political party might be influenced by those funding it (p.44).
The Green Paper (Faulkner 2008) also referred to the strong link between disclosure and transparency. It
explained that:
Disclosure is founded on the principle that the public has a right to know the extent and
nature of the financial involvement of political parties, independent candidates and other
participants in the political process (p.47).
Despite the importance of disclosure to the democratic process, there is very little consistency in relation
to disclosure thresholds across Australia. Indeed, this issue demonstrates just how mismatched political
donation laws are in Australia. This is particularly disturbing as disclosure laws are the essence of an open
and accountable political donations regime. Such regimes keep safe the ‘integrity and fairness of public
decision making’ (OECD 2016, p.70).
DISCLOSURE GAPS: NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
The OECD (2016, p.70) points to two advantages of transparency. The first is it acts as ‘a guard against
corruption and improper influence’. The second is that it promotes timely disclosure. Knowing who
donated what to whom months and, in some cases, over a year, after an election, which is what happens
in some Australian jurisdictions, makes a mockery of any transparent political donations regime. No
legislator (member of parliament) who truly acts in the public interest and honours the public office-public
trust principle could fail to support more timely disclosure. If any do not agree, they need to make a case
to the public for retention of the current system. The electorate has a right to hear their argument. It
cannot be for technical reasons, as the technology exists for disclosure as soon as donations are made. For
example, in the United States, the Federal Electoral Commission Act stipulates that reports detailing received
donations must be made public within 48 hours. In practice, they are usually available within 24 hours
(OECD 2016, p.74).
25In its May 2016 budget the Victorian Government made provision for real-time reporting of medical
prescriptions in order to prevent ‘doctor shopping’ (ABC News 2016). Its silence was deafening, however,
in relation to making a similar provision for real-time disclosure of political donations. This is not surprising
given the hands-off approach that government takes to political donations policy.
The leader of the NSW Opposition, Luke Foley 12 , when addressing that state’s recent ALP conference
(February 2016), summed up the issue perfectly when he stated ‘disclosure delayed is disclosure denied’.
Foley went on to say that NSW Labor ‘will be the first political party in Australia to disclose donations when
we receive them’. He pledged that ‘no later than 12 months prior to the next election New South Wales
Labor will disclose the sources and amounts of state donations within seven days. No more delay’.
Foley went on to challenge the Liberals to make the same commitment. This, however, is unlikely to happen
because, according to Dr Stephen Kendal (2016, p.3), Premier Baird ‘flicked the [Schott] recommendations
to a committee ... for its consideration before any action is taken’.
Disclosure is absolutely necessary but on its own it is not sufficient. It is essential that any submitted data
be verified and audited. Those undertaking the audit need to be experts in the area, as experience helps
irregularities to be more readily identified.
PENALTIES: THE WET LETTUCE APPROACH
The current penalties for breaching electoral laws across Australia, outlined in Part B, make a mockery of
the country’s political donations regime. They are set far too low to act as any form of deterrent and, until
recently, allowed some breaches of electoral laws to go unpunished.
When Bill Shorten appeared before the Heydon Royal Commission into trade unions in July 2015,
he explained to the Commission that during his 2007 campaign to enter parliament, he received
approximately $75,000 in what were previously undisclosed donations. They included a $40,000 donation
that Shorten explained was received from a director of Unibilt who was ‘willing to donate a resource,
employ a person’. That person acted as Shorten’s campaign director from February to November 2007.
Shorten admitted to ‘forgetting’ to declare the donations. It seems his memory was only jogged a short time
before giving evidence to the Commission (Colman 2015). 13 At the time, failure to comply with the law had
to be prosecuted within three years, so no penalty was imposed.
Penalties have a preventive element in that they can dissuade people from breaking the law. But to do
so, sanctions needs to be significant. The reverse is currently the case in Australia in relation to political
donations laws.

13 Shorten explained to the Commission that he had declared the 2007 donations ‘within the last 144 hours or last Friday or Monday or Tuesday’ (Hurst 2015).
26PUBLIC FUNDING
The public funding rules in Australia present another complicated scenario. They again demonstrate
Australia’s mismatched and complicated approach to political funding, in particular to taxpayers’
contributions to the public funding element of the system. It helps to support the case for a unified
approach to how politics is funded in Australia, especially as the subsidy per eligible vote across the nine
political jurisdictions ranges from approximately $1.52 to $8.00 per vote.
But why should taxpayers bear some of the costs associated with individuals applying for the position of
member of parliament or senator, especially when taxpayers then go on to pay the salary, expenses and
benefits of all successful applicants? And why should taxpayers contribute to the cost of running political
parties when, as Sally Young (2013) points out, public funding has not been accompanied by ‘caps on
[overall] spending or limits on private donations’.
In effect, what the ‘unusual’ current public funding system does is spend taxpayers’ money without, in
most cases, imposing any limits on how much can be raised through private donations or placing a limit on
the total amount of money (public and private) that can be spent on an election campaign.
Young also links public funding to welfare payments by arguing that, ‘political parties that rail against
“big government” are shamelessly hypocritical. They don’t want others to be reliant on welfare or public
handouts but are heavily so themselves’.
The issue of public funding was discussed by a panel of experts at the Schott Inquiry and was the subject of
the inquiry’s Working Paper 3 (Schott et al 2014e). While the Working Paper focused on full public funding,
many of the arguments it raised apply to financing politics through partial public funding.
The Working Paper outlines several reasons for using taxpayers’ money to partially fund elections. As
it explained, it can be advantageous to the democratic process, in that it helps to ensure that all those
aspiring to office have access to adequate resources. Public funding enables them to stand for election and
to inform voters about their policy intentions and what other things they will do for the electorate should
they be the successful candidate. By broadening the number and type of person standing for election,
public funding helps prevent a situation whereby only those with considerable resources at their disposal
can afford to stand for parliament.
Other benefits from public funding include reducing a political party and candidates’ reliance on private
sources of funding. Mike Baird, in his frank (some might say fearless) and prophetic inaugural speech
to the NSW Parliament warned that ‘The potential remains today to buy legislation ... and I have formed
the view that donations are at a corrosive level in New South Wales’. He went on to promote full public
funding so as to ‘remove the potential to buy access and legislation’ (Schott et al 2014e, p.2). In 2014 then
opposition leader, John Robertson (Schott et al 2014e, p.2) also supported the introduction of full public
funding for elections. He linked it to good government, claiming that if a policy establishing full public
funding for NSW elections was introduced prior to the next election, it would result in ‘the cleanest’ election
‘ever’ in NSW.
27However, as was pointed out in Working Paper 3 (Schott et al 2014e), regardless of whether there is full or
partial public funding:
Some people will always seek to circumvent the restrictions to obtain more campaign
resources and gain an electoral advantage (p.2).
What is needed to prevent political donations systems being abused is cultural change, which results in
MPs and political parties always respecting electoral laws and complying with them. The only group that
can bring about that change is MPs and the political parties to which they belong.
PRIVATE FUNDING: WHO BENEFITS?
Donors, contributing large sums of money to political parties (for example, wealthy individuals, trade
unions and corporations) maintain that the contributions they make are mere expressions of their desire
to participate in the political process; to communicate politically (Walton 2015). This is the essence of the
case put forward by Unions NSW to the High Court of Australia (Unions New South Wales and Others v
New South Wales 2013) when they challenged an attempt by the NSW Government to confine donations
to eligible voters. The unions’ challenge was successful with the High Court finding that such a ban would
place an unreasonable burden on an ‘implied freedom of political communication’ in the Australian
Constitution.
In a more recent High Court case (Walton 2015), property developer Jeff McCloy challenged the NSW
Government’s ban on donations from property developers and the cap placed on donations more
generally (Walton 2015, pp.7-8). He did so on the basis that the ban breached an implied freedom to
political communication. McCloy was unsuccessful. As Walton (2015) explains in the Henry Halloran Trust
research report: The Ways of the World: Implications of Political Donations for the Integrity of Planning
Systems, the High Court:
... confirmed that the prevention of both corruption and undue influence [original emphasis]
are valid reasons for legislatures to restrict political donations, and that in the final analysis,
the Australian Constitution must be interpreted to serve the interests of democracy (p.7).
A central theme of the Halloran Report is the integrity of the planning process, which it argues is not
simply about whether donations are corrupt. Another important consideration is whether they result in
undue influence, which may not constitute corruption in a legal sense, but nevertheless have the potential
to impact negatively on the impartiality of a planning system. While McCloy’s case focused on property
developers, the same undue influence argument can be applied to other entities, including third party
campaigners and associated entities.
28PEDDLING PRIVILEGED ACCESS
Donations are not a one-sided affair. It is not simply a case of donors continually thrusting money onto
political parties and candidates in order to express their strong and very expensive desire to communicate
politically with parties and candidates, or as the electorate rightly or wrongly perceives, to influence public
policy outcomes that advantage the donor. Candidates (new and sitting members) and political parties
vigorously solicit donations from certain donors, sometimes to the point where the pursued donor begins
to feel like a ‘walking ATM’.
Not only can private donors be hounded for donations by political parties, sometimes for truly exorbitant
amounts of money, they can have breakfast, lunch or dinner with senior parliamentarians, with the
rate charged to attend a function climbing as high as $20,000, depending on the seniority of the
parliamentarians attending the event (Lewis 2014).
This form of ‘influence peddling’ grants access to very senior parliamentarians who have the power to
make significant decisions in many areas of public policy. Those who can afford to pay are granted a far
superior level of access to decision-makers than ‘ordinary’ voters who lack the financial capacity to gain
entry to these undemocratic events. And they are undemocratic, for democracy is supposed to be about
political equality. This is something that many senior parliamentarians, who willingly (even eagerly) sell
access to their work-related time, paid for by the taxpayer, seem to have forgotten. Clearly, MPs need to be
reminded that they are elected to parliament in order to make decisions in the public interest. Revisiting
their fiduciary duty to voters may lead them back to the public interest path from which too many appear
to have strayed.
As the author wrote in 2014, selling money-driven privileged access also treats nearly all voters with
disdain. The message, perceived or real is: give me your vote, but unless you pay large sums of money, you
are not welcome to dine, for several hours, with me and other senior members of my political party.
Buying privileged access is not peculiar to Australia. It is a problem for democracies around the world and
many are concerned about the trust deficit between the elected representatives of the people and those
who elect them to office. Part of the reason why the deficit is growing is the perception that members
of parliament disproportionately favour the privileged. For example, media attention in the Canadian
provinces of British Columbia (BC) and Ontario is currently focused on political donations. The media has
revealed that corporations and lobbyists are paying $10,000 (approximately 20 per cent of the average
annual wage) to dine privately with the premier. The bill for dining with the minister responsible for the
liquor industry and British Columbia’s premier is more expensive and equates to a $15,000 donation to
BC’s Liberal Party. The invitation to discuss issues surrounding the liquor industry was at the behest of the
responsible minister. Perhaps even more disturbing, is the revelation that the Liberal Premier of Ontario,
Kathleen Wynne, admitted that the party she leads ‘sets annual fundraising targets for cabinet ministers of
up to $500,000’. Bill Tieleman (2016), in an opinion piece for The Tyee (BC) discussed the above issues and
went on to explain:
It does not matter if ... [the BC Premier] or cabinet ministers say the big donations and
special dinners don’t affect their decision. The perception that people with money can buy
political influence is impossible to erase without meaningful legislative changes.
29Something needs to change in Canada. But it also needs to change in Australia. As Katharine Murphy
explains in her thought-provoking 2015 article The Politics We Deserve, ‘Australian politics has to go back to
its roots’, which she reminds us means going ‘back to people’. But there are obstacles in the way:
Standing between people and their parliament is a toxic swamp of self-interested rent seekers
intent on making parliamentarians their puppets. The rent seekers move in at the first whiff
of any “reform” debate, eager to annihilate any grey areas and safeguard their interests-
stakeholder advancement first, broader public or national interest a distant second (p.22.).
The only people who can legislate the necessary changes to reverse the priority order outlined in the above
quote, are Australia’s political leaders; yet they are unwilling to come together to do so. Until they do, trust
in members of parliament and the political process will continue to spiral.
PREVENTING POLICY CAPTURE
Poorly regulated systems, the OECD (2016, p.15) points out, allows powerful and influential corporations,
unions, lobbyists, and various interest groups, to exert undue influence on the policy process: to ‘capture’
it. When this happens inappropriate, not fit for purpose policies are approved and implemented by
governments. The consequences are significant for, as Althaus, Bridgman and Davis (2012) explain, public
policy pervades all aspects of people’s lives.
In order to protect the trustworthiness of the public policy process and lessen the risk of policy capture
by the rich, powerful or influential (OECD 2016, p.17), it is important to address the possibility that some
members of parliament and political parties will be more receptive to the wishes of donors than the
general electorate, and when that happens it occurs at the expense of the public interest. As Murphy (2015)
convincingly points out:
There are entirely viable alternatives to the current system of funding and disclosure, yet
the major parties can’t seem to come to terms on prescriptions that would strengthen their
position at the expense of the puppet masters. In this obstinacy they are the ultimate boiling
frogs (p.24).
The OECD (2016) Report warns that those who donate to political campaigns may expect a sort of
‘reimbursement for donations made during an election’ (p.22), which could lead to policy capture (p.24).
To do all that is possible to prevent this, policy makers need to implement laws that provide a framework
that minimises opportunities to game the system. In Australia, this involves moving to a national political
donations regime and coming to a consensus on key drivers that would form the framework for such
a policy. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this must be done according to the public office-public trust
principle..
ARE WE WITNESSING AN ARMS RACE?
In the 2008 Green Paper (referred to previously), then Senator John Faulkner raised the issue of an electoral
campaigning ‘arms race’. He warned that Australia’s democracy was facing new challenges, one being the
accelerating expenses associated with electioneering.
30The primary expense for political parties is tied to electoral campaigning, and this mainly takes place
through media advertising, the costs of which, Faulkner (2008) pointed out some eight years ago, are
‘increasing at rates far in excess of inflation’ (p.9). They continue to rise.
Senator Rhiannon made known her concerns in the previously mentioned dissenting report to the JSCEM
(2011). She argued that:
Over the last three decades the scale of spending in Australian elections has sky rocketed,
with both major parties engaging in a funding arms race that has seen a rapid increase in
the amount of money spent in Australian and state elections. The spending increase has
outstripped the availability of public funding, and thus private donations to major political
parties have increased markedly, particularly from business and lobby groups who are most
affected by government legislation (p.233).
She went on to point out that the rise in political donations has led to a culture where:
... large donors have gained privileged access to ministers and MPs, and policy decisions
have benefitted large donors such as property developers (p.234).
This Senator Rhiannon explained has:
[Led to the] perception that corporate donors are buying influence. In some cases there is
evidence that this perception accurately reflects the real relationship between politicians and
donors (p.234).
A sensible way to stop the arms race is to put a ceiling on what can be expended on election campaigns.
31CONCLUSION
The Australian community has made known its ‘disgust’ with elements of this country’s political donations
system. However reforming it requires the silent majority to cease being silent. Political donations need
to become an election issue at every federal, state and territory election, until such times as this country’s
political leaders establish a national approach to how politics is funded in Australia.
The difficulty the Australian community faces in achieving such an outcome rests on convincing those
with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo to reform the system. But the prospect of achieving
meaningful and speedy reform is hampered somewhat by the reality that moving to a national political
donations policy comes with a sting.
The sting emanates from the fact that most of the beneficiaries of the status quo are the same group of
people invested with the legislative power to rectify the current deficiencies in Australia’s electoral laws.
These include: the ‘laissez-faire’ approach to banning particular groups of donors and to caps on donations;
the antiquated and undemocratic approach blanketing receipt of donations and their disclosure; and the
grossly inadequate, some might believe laughable sanctions for breaching electoral laws. It is not surprising
that the public has so little trust in political leaders, members of parliament, political parties and the political
process when they deliver such muddled public policy. Perhaps voters need reminding that ultimate power
rests with them and, like their elected representatives, they should use that power in the (national) public
interest.
The author is not politically naïve and appreciates that asking governments to support and implement a
national approach is fraught with challenges for them on many levels, but as referred to often in this paper,
there are public office-public trust principles that can guide them through the very real maze of conflicting
priorities and loyalties. Reaching a consensus on adopting a national approach to political funding laws
would demonstrate to the electorate, in every political jurisdiction, that their representatives understand
and accept that election to parliament obliges them to always prioritise the public interest when making
decisions that affect the public.
While changing the system to a national one is a necessary step to a more open, transparent and equitable
system, it does not go far enough. There needs to be an independent mechanism for overseeing the
system, which goes beyond the Australian Electoral Commission. There is also a need for a national anti-
corruption commission with the coercive powers required to shine an accountability spotlight onto political
donations laws in the way that ICAC in NSW has been able to do at the local government and state level.

33COMMONWEALTH
BANNED DONORS
There are no banned donors at the Commonwealth level.
CAPS ON DONATIONS
No caps apply
DISCLOSURE THRESHOLD/RULES
The Commonwealth disclosure threshold is indexed, starting with the ‘more than $10,000’ amendment
made in 2005. It is currently (July 2015-June 2016) ‘more than $13,000’. (http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_
Representatives/public_funding/threshold.htm)
Donors (that is, any person or organisation that makes a donation to a political party, candidate, or third
party for the benefit of a political party) must lodge either a ‘donor to political party return’ or ‘election
donor return’, subject to the disclosure threshold. Body corporates are held to be a single entity, and
donations are aggregated across the group for a single return. (http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_
Representatives/financial_disclosure/guides/donors/index.htm)
Federal, state and territory branches of political parties are counted as separate for the purposes of
disclosure. The AEC notes that several state and territory jurisdictions have their own disclosure schemes.
These are separate to the federal funding and disclosure scheme administered by the AEC. (http://www.
aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/financial_disclosure/guides/political-parties/index.htm)
PENALTIES FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW
Failure to lodge a return by the due date incurs a fine of $5,000 for agents of a political party and $1,000
in all other cases. The fine for lodging a false or misleading return is $10,000/$5,000, respectively. This
has not changed since 2005. (http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/financial_disclosure/

34PUBLIC FUNDING
Federal electoral funding is calculated by multiplying formal first preference votes by the rate of payment.
The rate of payment is indexed every six months and is currently (January-June 2016) 262.259 cents, or

A person who is a prohibited donor and who makes a payment to a party for a membership of the party
or for affiliation with the party is permitted to pay less than $1,000 per financial year to the party for these
purposes. Any amounts paid to a party by a person for these purposes in a financial year that are $1,000
or more are prohibited. (http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/129750/EF_00-0077_

•	 for membership of a party the maximum subscription allowed is $2,000 per member
•	 for an affiliation with a party the maximum subscription allowed is:
•	 $2,000 if the amount of the subscription is not based on the number of affiliate
members, or
•	 $2,000 multiplied by the number of affiliate members if the amount of the subscription

42PUBLIC FUNDING
Candidates qualify to claim election funding if they poll at least 6% (4% before the Electoral Reform
Amendment Bill 2013) of the formal first preference vote in the electorate contested. Public funding for
candidates at state elections in Queensland is a reimbursement scheme. Election funding cannot exceed
actual campaign related expenditure.
If a candidate endorsed by a registered political party and the party both claim to have incurred the same
expenditure, the Act provides that the expenditure is incurred by the party.

44TASMANIA
POLITAICAL DONATIONS
Tasmania has no laws relating to political donations.
CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE
It does have laws relating to expenditure.
A candidate’s expenditure cannot exceed the expenditure limit. This limit was $10,000 in 2005 and
increases by $500 each year (making it currently $15,500). A candidate who incurs expenditure not
exceeding $1,000 over this limit is liable to be fined 0.05 penalty units per $1 over the expenditure limit
(a single penalty unit is currently indexed at $154). A candidate who incurs expenditure exceeding $1,000
over this limit is liable to be fined 150 penalty units. (http://www.justice.tas.gov.au/about/legislation/value_
of_indexed_units_in_legislation)
An election expenditure return must be submitted within 60 days of the election results’ declaration. All
expenditure over $20 must be accompanied by an invoice or receipt. The penalty for not submitting a
return is 200 penalty units. Submitting a false or misleading return incurs a fine of 300 penalty units or 12
months imprisonment.
In 2013, Parliament passed an amendment that banned parties incurring expenditure from promoting or
procuring the election of a candidate, regardless of whether they are a candidate endorsed by the party.
Only the candidate and their electoral agent may incur expenditure; the penalty is 200 penalty units or 6
months imprisonment. (http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=;doc_id=51%2B%2B2004%

45VICTORIA
BANNED DONORS
There are no banned donors in Victoria.
CAPS ON DONATIONS
The holder of a ‘relevant licence’ (or a related company under section 50 of the Corporations Act) cannot
make a donation to a registered political party that exceeds $50,000 in a single financial year. This refers to
a licence granted under the Casino Control Act or the Gambling Regulation Act. (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/
legis/vic/consol_act/ea2002103/s216.html)
DISCLOSURE THRESHOLD/RULES
There is no requirement for disclosure in Victoria. However, the larger parties are organised on a State
basis, with State branches being registered federally as well as the national organisations: federal disclosure
laws apply to federally registered political parties. Therefore, as the larger parties are also registered under
Victorian law, it is possible to learn about donations to Victorian parties by examining the disclosures of the
Victorian branches of the federally registered parties. Additionally, under Section 222 of Victoria’s Electoral
Act 2002, Victorian registered parties have to provide the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) with a copy
of their annual return to the AEC. (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ea2002103/s222.html)
46PENALTIES FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW
Under Section 217 of the Victorian Electoral Act 2002, if the amount by which the total amount or value of
the political donations to a registered political party exceeds $50,000, the excess is forfeited to the state.
(http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/web_notes/ldms/pubstatbook.nsf/f932b66241ecf1b7ca256e920
00e23be/3264bf1de203c08aca256e5b00213ffb/$FILE/02-023a.pdf)
Under Section 222 of the Victorian Electoral Act 2002 the registered officer of a registered political party
must give to the VEC a copy of the annual return provided on behalf of the registered political party under
section 314AC of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 as soon as the annual return has been provided
under that section. Penalties and offences are outlined below in Section 217 and Section 218 of the
Victorian Electoral Act 2002:
Offence: Giving a statement containing particulars that are false or misleading to the knowledge of
the registered officer/candidate.
Penalty: 120 penalty units (currently $18,200.40) for a registered officer; 60 penalty units (currently
$9,100.20) for a candidate. As well, the court may order a refund of the public funding payment.
Offence: Deliberately providing false or misleading information to a person required to give a
statement.
Penalty: 10 penalty units (currently $1,516.70)
http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ea2002103/s217.html http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/
vic/consol_act/ea2002103/s218.html
PUBLIC FUNDING
Candidates who receive more than 4% of first preference votes currently receive $1.66 per vote. It is
indexed to the CPI (every 6 months). Public funding goes to the party for party candidates, and to the
candidate for independent candidates. (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ea2002103/s211.
html)
To get public funding, the party or independent candidate has to submit an audited statement of
expenditure to the VEC. Only certain types of expenditure can be included (mainly advertising). The
statement does not have to detail the expenditure, but does have to state whether this expenditure
exceeds the public funding entitlement or is less than the entitlement. If the expenditure is less than
the entitlement, the party or candidate only receives the amount spent. As identified above, there are
substantial penalties for deliberately providing false or misleading information in a statement. (http://www.
austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ea2002103/s209.html)

48AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY
BANNED DONORS
There are no banned donors in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
CAPS ON DONATIONS
No caps apply on donations in the ACT.
The Electoral Amendment Act 2015 commenced on 3 March 2015. This removed the cap on donations
entirely (previously, it had been capped at $10,000).
DISCLOSURE THRESHOLD/RULES
Donations over $1,000 must be disclosed.
Under the Electoral Amendment Act 2015:
•	 donations may be received from organisations and persons not enrolled for ACT
purposes and irrespective of their place of residence
•	 Associated entities of a political party are not considered part of that party in terms of
the expenditure cap. They are subject to an independent expenditure cap.
The electoral expenditure cap decreased to $40,000 (indexed by CPI for future elections), down from
$60,000. The following groups are considered distinct and independent in terms of the expenditure cap:
•	 Candidates for party groupings (up to a maximum of 25 candidates)
•	 Non-party candidates
•	 Third party campaigners
•	 Associated entities
Anonymous gifts (that is, gifts under $1,000) may not exceed $25,000 in total. This cap previously applied
only to gifts that were less than $250.
Changes have been made to the timing for the regular reporting of gifts so that:
•	 In an election year, if the value of the gift or gifts received from a person reaches $1,000
in the financial year between 1 April and 30 June, the declaration must be made to the
Electoral Commissioner by 7 July;
•	 In an election year, if the value of the gift or gifts received from a person reaches $1,000
in the financial year after 30 June and before the end of polling day, the declaration
must be made to the Electoral Commissioner 7 days after the total amount received
from the person reaches $1,000; and
49•	
In a non-election year, or in the first quarter (1 January until 31 March) of an election
year, if the value of the gift or gifts received from a person reaches $1,000 in the financial
year, the declaration must be made to the Electoral Commissioner within 30 days of the
end of the financial quarter in which the total amount received from the person reached
$1,000.
Disclosure returns must be submitted by 31 August.
The capped expenditure period lasts from 1 January until the end of polling day. For the 2016 election, it is
the period from 1 January 2016 until the end of polling day (15 October 2016).
An ACT registered political party may not use payments received of more than $10,000 in a financial year
from a related party, for the purposes of incurring ACT electoral expenditure.
(http://www.elections.act.gov.au/funding_and_disclosure/new_electoral_campaign_finance_laws_in_the_
act2)
PENALTIES FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW
Part 17 of the ACT Electoral Act 1992 (pp.228-249) identifies and categorises many electoral offences and

Joint Declaration on Open Government
for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development
As participants in the Open Government Partnership, commit-
ted to the principles enshrined in the Open Government Dec-
laration, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United
Nations Convention Against Corruption and other relevant in-
ternational instruments related to effective and inclusive insti-
tutions and human rights, we:
Recognize the importance of harnessing our efforts and cham-
pioning the principles of transparency and open government
as crucial tools for ensuring the effective implementation of the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Acknowledge this is an ambitious global plan of action for achiev-
ing inclusive sustainable development in its economic, political,
social and environmental dimensions, in a balanced and inte-
grated manner to end poverty and combat inequality within and
among countries.
Welcome the inclusion in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development of goals and targets related to transparency,
accountability, integrity and citizen participation. They are es-
sential for promoting the rule of law, reducing corruption, and
promoting public access to information and the development of
effective and accountable institutions.
Applaud the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for rec-
ognizing that peaceful and inclusive societies are vital compo-
nents of sustainable development.
Value and welcome the participation of civil society organiza-
tions in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development.
Promote the Open Government Partnership as a platform for
voluntary cooperation and peer exchange and learning. The ex-
perience of its participating governments and civil society orga-
nizations can be drawn on to encourage transparent, account-
able, participatory, and technology-enabled implementation of
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Together, we declare our commitment to:
1. Promote the rule of law consistent with international stan-
dards at the national, regional and international level through
transparency, openness, accountability, access to justice and
effective and inclusive institutions. This is consistent with Goal
16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
2. Promote public access to timely and disaggregated informa-
tion and open data on government activities related to the im-
plementation and financing of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, in line with national legislation and international
commitments . We support development of the International
Open Data Charter and intend to explore its implementation in
our countries.
3. Support citizen participation in the implementation of all the
goals and targets in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop-
ment, including decision-making, policy formulation, follow up
and evaluation processes.
4. Uphold the principles of open government, as described in
the Open Government Declaration, when defining international,
regional and national indicators for measuring the implementa-
tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, taking
into account national circumstances and development priori-
ties. We will identify and share lessons learned and good prac-
tices to strengthen country capacity for implementation.
5. Use our Open Government Partnership National Action Plans
to adopt commitments that serve as effective tools to pro-
mote transparent and accountable implementation of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development
