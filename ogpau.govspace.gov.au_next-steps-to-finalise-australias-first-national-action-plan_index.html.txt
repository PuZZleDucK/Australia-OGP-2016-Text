****** Next steps to finalise Australia’s first National Action Plan ******
Posted on October_18,_2016  by  ogpteam
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has written_to_the_Open
Government_Partnership to confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s
first National Action Plan.
The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow adequate time
for consultation within government and with the Australian public. The
timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that has been put into
developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group of senior public servants
and civil society stakeholders.
Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two weeks. The
Government will consider public comments before submitting the Plan to the Open
Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or sign_up
to the mailing list for updates!
