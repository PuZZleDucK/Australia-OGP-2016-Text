Appendix A: Sub-categories of themes – summary of input received
This document is a summary of engagement undertaken between November 2015 and
19 May 2016 for the development of Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan.
It summarises the channels used for engagement, how stakeholders used these channels
during the engagement period and the key themes of input received during engagement. It
also outlines lessons learned by engage2 during the process, and our recommendation to
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) for ongoing engagement with
stakeholders during the delivery and implementation of the National Action Plan.
The strategy to engage stakeholders during the development of the National Action Plan
was published as a draft in February 2016 as an extension of the consultation plan outlined
by PM&C in November 2015. Updates made during the project and the original consultation
plans are all available on the OGPAU website: https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/contribute/

Purpose of engagement
To encourage collaboration among stakeholders across Australia, working with them to
develop suggested actions to be included in the Open Government National Action Plan.
Three stages of engagement:
There were five stages of the project, the first three involved engagement (see image 2).
1.
Stage 1: Preparation, framework and history (November – December 2015).
To inform stakeholders and encourage their input into the design of consultation
and input into the background and context sections of the document
2.
Stage 2: Raise awareness, gather suggestions (January – March 2016)
To promote the project and encourage stakeholders to suggest potential actions for
consideration in the National Action Plan.
3.
Stage 3: Prioritisation and drafting workshop (April – May 2016)
To encourage discussion about, and prioritisation of, suggested actions and
co-create templates for potential commitments for Ministers and Cabinet to consider
in Stage 4.
4. Stage 4: Consideration of the National Action Plan by the Australian Government.
5. Stage 5: Launch of the National Action Plan.
At the time of writing, stages 4 and 5 had been delayed by the timing of the Federal election,
and the associated caretaker conventions.
Please refer to the strategy document for more information about the stages, objectives for
each stage and channels used for engagement: https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/contribute/

Image 2: Stages of engagementApproach to engagement
Engagement was designed to encourage participation from anyone. It was not a deliberative
or representative process, but we did our best to reach stakeholders across Australia.
engage2 sought to raise awareness of the project and suggested actions, as well as
promote opportunities to participate.
Our approach was: open; transparent; accessible; responsive; efficient for stakeholders and
government; and we intentionally set out to build stakeholder capabilities to engage in the
process.
The project team was named publicly and all communications were signed off with their
direct contact details; stakeholders could easily contact the project team at any time to get
support and have their questions answered. Multiple channels were used to make it easy for
people to participate at varying degrees of engagement. Weekly updates were provided
about engagement and teleconferences took place as open discussions with questions
answered in real time; records of teleconferences were uploaded to the wiki for those
interested who could not attend.
engage2 identified ‘primary stakeholders’ including state government Open Government
teams, Local Government Associations, related professional associations and convenors of
Open Government networks. engage2 engaged with them directly at the start of the process
so they could engage their networks early on. engage2 also attended industry events and
provided newsletter content, and ‘Introduction to Open Government’ and ‘How to Suggest an
Action’ tips and templates content for stakeholders to share with their networks.
Degrees of engagement
We accommodated three levels of engagement in the process. Participants could:
 Stay informed – by registering for updates
 Get involved – by suggesting an action on the wiki, commenting on updates on the
blog; participating in OGP events (teleconferences and co-creation workshop);
making a submission
 Collaborate – join an OGP working group; host an event; participate in the
co-creation workshop
These levels are presented in image 2, and image 3 outlines how many stakeholders
engaged at various levels.
Engagement was promoted through:
 Information sessions run by PM&C during November and December in 4 locations
across Australia. The hashtag #ogpau was created and one of these sessions was
videocast so participants who could not attend physical locations could join the
discussion.
 16 updates were sent about the project by email and uploaded to the blog.
The channels set up for engagement included:
 OGPAU Website and blog: http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au
 OGPAU Wiki – share an idea, comment on others: http://ogpau.wikispaces.com
 Email to PM&C at ogp@pmc.gov.au and to engage2 at Amelia@engage2.com.au
 Phone inquiries directly to Amelia Loye (engage2) at 0411950585
Page 5 of 34 | Teleconferences using join.me
 Co-creation workshop in Canberra on 12 th April
 Interested stakeholders could request participation from the project team at their
events through an online form
 The hashtag #ogpau was created to discuss the project on social media
 Participants could also join the OGP working groups – these were promoted during
Stage 2 of the project to encourage stakeholders to suggest an action

 The stakeholder list now includes 430 stakeholders, a 34% increase since 1 February
2016. 84 of these stakeholders have consented to ongoing engagement to date –
see image 11 below. A survey has been set up to gain permission to share contact
details.
Image 11: Consent to share contact details
Page 15 of 34 |Request for ongoing engagement
During the co-creation workshop and since the event in April, several stakeholders have
expressed their views about ongoing engagement. They have requested that an interim
multi-stakeholder group be set up to enable greater partnership among senior government
officials and non-government representatives to engage more of civil society, business and
other organisations. They would like this group to report to the Prime Minister to showcase
and further develop the draft National Action Plan. After being trialled, they would like to see
this interim arrangement established as a formal mechanism for ongoing OGP engagement.
They have requested government cover the expenses of members of the interim committee.
Page 16 of 34 |Lessons learned
What worked well

Working with, not for, PM&C meant that engage2 could:
o relate to, and build personal relationships with, stakeholders which
helped to increase trust;
o be open and transparent about the engagement process and answer
questions from our perspective not as representatives of government;
o be proactive at sharing information and project updates without having to
go through editing and approval processes;
o be responsive and accessible to stakeholders when they had questions;
o support stakeholders to provide input into formats that made it easier for
government to consider and respond to; and
o encourage engagement and collaboration among them when they had
related ideas; which meant collaborative relationships were developed
and ideas were refined before the co-creation workshop.
 The teleconferences had several advantages:
o stakeholders could participate from home or their office, appreciated
Amelia answering questions in real time and in front of others, and
enjoyed talking to each other;
o they were informal interactions that gave stakeholders recognition for
their investment into the process and helped them build relationships
with each other before the workshop which supported ongoing open
government delivery;
o having a clear agenda, structure and facilitation helped keep discussion
on track and ensured everyone who participated had significant time for
introductions and questions; and
o using video worked particularly well – even if only available to some
stakeholders.
 Online comments required logging in which ensured stakeholders were credited
for their investment and input, and also increased accountability of those
commenting online.
 Providing a name and direct contact details demonstrated openness and provided a
personal touch which stakeholders appreciated. Initially it was thought this would
result in more contact from stakeholders and possible spamming, but it actually had
the opposite effect. Being available demonstrated transparency and openness, and
meant stakeholder questions were answered quickly in a personal fashion that
stakeholders appreciated.
 This personalised support also meant that Amelia was able to build good
working relationships with motivated and passionate stakeholders making both
online and offline engagement, and issues management more effective. For
example, through:
Page 17 of 34 |o knowing stakeholders and their interests meant Amelia could
acknowledge and respond to them directly which helped with
moderation;
o by the time stakeholders arrived at the co-creation workshop they knew
Amelia and she was able to acknowledge their investment, passions and
input, facilitate the dynamics in the room and increase the level of
collaboration and co-creation;
o identifying passionate and motivated stakeholders; making sure they were
engaged early, that their interests were understood, personally inviting them
to have a role in the process and letting them know they can talk openly at
any time; and
o being transparent with stakeholders about how their input would be used and
offering them support to shape it into useful formats for Government
consideration. Connecting them to other stakeholders with similar interests so
they can discuss ideas and work together on suggested actions.
 Tracking and reporting input as frequently as possible to both PM&C and the public
helped stakeholders understand each other’s interests and build on each other’s
ideas. Publishing comments on the wiki encouraged stakeholders to engage with
each other and also helped government understand what stakeholders were
interested in so they could discuss the input internally and prepare an official
response.
Opportunities for improvement
 A longer lead-time for engagement would have helped to expand the reach of
engagement. It was hard to get the attention of the NGO and business sectors. Many
had never heard of the Open Government Partnership and communicating the
opportunity took time. As stakeholders started to understand the opportunity they
were more likely to engage and promote engagement among their networks.
 Increased promotion of the project through media and social media would have
helped to increase awareness of the project and may have expanded the reach of
engagement.
 Leveraging soft media like industry newsletters and events was very effective.
Promoting newsletter content and encouraging greater involvement of the project
team in events would have helped increase reach and depth of engagement.
 Stakeholders wanted to see more ownership of the project from PM&C and greater
transparency around the way the political arm of government was engaging in the
process.
 Greater clarity around the challenges and a statement about issues that were not
being addressed through this process was required to manage expectations and
would have helped to redirect attention / tension around those topics away from the
project.
 To deliver on all the actions suggested, Government would also need to nominate an
organisation that could manage and respond to actions suggested for Parliamentary
openness and reform. Having an organisation like this involved would have:
o emphasised the separation of powers between the Parliament and
bureaucracy
Page 18 of 34 |o helped to demonstrate accountability at that level of Government, and
removed the pressure off the project team to manage inquiries about issues
outside their remit
o helped to educate stakeholders about role (and limitations) of the bureaucracy
in open government making the scope of influence clearer.
 To the point above, it would have been useful at the start of the process for the Open
Government Partnership Support Unit to provide greater clarity to both the public and
the project team about how these types of issues are usually addressed in action
plans among other partners.
 The teleconferences worked well – they were responsive to stakeholders needs and
project dynamics - but it may have been better to:
o have a combination of planned and responsive teleconferences throughout
the process. Scheduling teleconferences, particularly later in the process,
would have enabled stakeholder interested in meeting each other and
participating in person, to organise local events where they could participate
as a group; and
o have a mix of sessions for just stakeholders, and a mix with government
representatives. For example, scheduling a regular session with
representatives at the beginning and end of a teleconference, then allowing
time for open discussion amongst civil society during the middle of the
teleconference agenda may have helped to increase the transparency of the
internal processes and may have helped to build relationships between
stakeholders with government.
 Tracking and reporting input frequently to government and the public could have
been done better by providing input from both the blog and wiki page in a format that
was easier for both government and stakeholders to consider and respond to.
 Select digital tools and integrate technology used for engagement that makes it
easier to track issues, analyse and report data collected through engagement. This
process was manual, which was slow, making it hard to show real time summaries of
issues and reducing the time available to engage with stakeholders. This would have
also helped with the point above.
 Social media listening did not work on this project largely due to the limited promotion
of content about the project. Promoting more content would have allowed us visibility
of who shared it and built upon it. Understanding this may have helped to identify
stakeholders, influencers and networks for engagement around the project and
ongoing open government actions across Australia.
 The response to Local Government Associations’ engagement was mixed. It is
recommended that PM&C engage with these groups more formally to introduce Open
Government Partnership and invite their involvement in engaging Local Government
Associations.
 An email informing stakeholders about caretaker mode and its impact on the project
would have helped to ‘close the loop’ with stakeholders engaged.
 Engage with representatives from government and civil society from Tasmania and
Northern Territory. If representatives are not present, identify potential organisations
or individuals likely to be interested and help build capacity in the region.
Page 19 of 34 | Hold co-creation workshops in multiple major cities to allow individuals unable to fund
themselves to travel to Canberra to participate.
 Increased engagement with Indigenous and Torres Strait communities and
organisation to allow for improved representation in the process.
Page 20 of 34 |Recommendations
1. Publish this report
It is recommended that this report be made public to demonstrate transparency and to
support the Independent Reporting Mechanism.
2. Update stakeholders and ‘close the loop’
Closing the loop of engagement is about wrapping up the current stage of the project,
thanking stakeholders for their investment into the process, acknowledging input and
advising them about the outcome of the project or next stage of the process.
To close the loop with stakeholders engaged through this process, it is recommended that:
i.
ii.
An email update be sent to all stakeholders to:
o Thank them for their time, their input and the actions suggested and their
support to get the National Action Plan to this stage of development.
o Inform them about the status of the plans and how they can stay updated
about the project (and the delivery of action).
o Request consent for the ongoing use and sharing of their contact details from
those who have not already provided it.
o Link to this engagement report published on the project or engage2 website.
o Invite ongoing contact and/or participation in ongoing engagement for OGP
engagement - or to inform them about when to expect an update about the
formal ongoing engagement mechanism.
o Acknowledge progress on Open Government in Australia more generally.
Release a detailed outline of how input received to date has been considered and
addressed as a compliment to this engagement report. This should include a
summary of how each commitment template prepared at the co-creation workshop
has been responded to.
3. Consultation to finalise the National Action Plan
Given that the finalisation of Australia’s National Action Plan has been held up by the
election, it is recommended that after the election PM&C continue to engage stakeholders in
the development of the National Action Plan. This engagement should include:
i.
Consultation on the draft National Action Plan – enabling comments or asking
questions at specific sections of the document, including each potential
commitment;
OR
ii.
Consultation on the commitment templates drafted at the co-creation workshop with
specific questions asked to indicate the Government’s position about them and
request further input for consideration.
This process will need to clarify which commitments are on the table for further consideration
in the National Action Plan and which ones are not. It is highly recommended that clear
responses also be provided to actions proposed / drafted commitment templates that will not
Page 21 of 34 |be addressed through the current National Action Plan. This may also include a second
engagement process, as outlined below.
This process should also seek to reach stakeholders not well represented in the process
including:
 Not for profit sector
 Indigenous representatives
If any new commitments are proposed in the draft to be launched for consultation, it is
recommended that stakeholders who have provided input to date on related topics and those
who may be impacted be engaged directly prior to the launch.
This engagement should include a mix of online and face-to-face engagement, and should
get beyond the capital cities. It is recommended that government agencies that will lead
drafted commitments nominate a key representative for this engagement and that they are
briefed about input to date and relationships built so the investment made by stakeholders is
recognised and partnerships for delivery can be established.
4. A separate engagement process about Parliamentary Openness
It is understood that some countries in the OGP have developed a separate Plan for
Parliamentary openness and reform. Based on this information and input collected
throughout this engagement, it is recommended that the Australian Government consider
running a second engagement process so actions that cannot be delivered by government
agencies can be considered.
An authority that could accept responsibility to deliver these kinds of actions would need to
be nominated to manage this engagement process.
This would help the Government complete the current action plan, emphasise the separation
of powers and demonstrate a willingness of the Government to consider development of a
second National Action Plan that addresses Parliamentary openness specifically.
5. Ongoing engagement for the National Action Plan OGP
The formal mechanism
The OGP requires that a formal mechanism be created for ongoing engagement. In the
co-creation workshop it was proposed that PM&C recommend that a commitment to this
formal mechanism be included in Australia’s National Action Plan.
It is recommended that this formal mechanism be:

Populated through an expression of interest that is widely promoted with clear
criteria for the group. As a starting point, this criteria might include:
Page 22 of 34 |
o representativeness – demographic, across sectors, discursive and regional
representation should be sought
o some experience using Open Data, engaging stakeholders or engaging with
government
o representatives from other levels of government
o regional open government champions
o access to variety of networks / industries / communitieso
representatives who are experienced at reaching Culturally Linguistically
Diverse Communities and people from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds
 funded but not managed by government
 appointed and managed by an independent body and that a secretariat be provided
to support the management of this group including:
o coordination and facilitation of meetings
o publishing of meeting outputs
o opportunities for other stakeholders to provide feedback on outputs of the
formal mechanism and input into their discussions
o engagement with the OGP Support Unit and working groups
Several stakeholders formed a group, called the Australian Open Government Partnership
Network (AOGPN), early in the engagement process. It is recommended that their members
be invited to express their interest in participating in the formal mechanism but that this
organisation does not become the formal mechanism.
The stakeholders in this group are highly experienced in Open Government and highly
effective advocates. The insight into Open Government they have shown throughout this
process and their willingness to drive Open Government in Australia has been invaluable.
Their ongoing engagement will be critical to the success of the OGP in Australia. It should
be noted that their membership is not representative of the spectrum of topics covered by
Open Government, and several stakeholders throughout the engagement process
expressed a discomfort with joining the group because they felt their approach was geared
to lobbying ~ advocacy as opposed to collaboration.
To meet the proposed criteria for a formal mechanism outlined above, this group should
adjust the way they engage with other stakeholders outside of their core team. They would
also require a secretariat and ongoing funding to be sustainable and deliver the
transparency and engagement required by a formal ongoing engagement mechanism.
Amelia has made these suggestions to four members of the AOGPN Steering Committee
directly.
Delivery of the actions proposed
Each of the commitment templates name a lead agency and partners to support the delivery
of proposed commitments and actions. It is recommended that the agencies nominated to
lead these actions engage with these stakeholders to acknowledge input, enlist support, and
demonstrate transparency and the desire to work with stakeholders as soon as possible.
To support this engagement it is recommended that PM&C:
 Brief lead agencies about specific stakeholders engaged throughout the OGP
process whose input relates to their commitments and whose involvement would
help to support their delivery of actions proposed. Then request consent from
stakeholders to share their contact details with agencies.
 Share contact details of those who have provided consent at the co-creation
workshop as soon as possible
State government engagement
Some of the commitments proposed require the implementation of standards and the
coordination of activities across levels of government. Our engagement with the state and
Page 23 of 34 |government Open Government teams was very well received. Several states have
significant teams and initiatives and were keen for further leadership and engagement from
PM&C about Open Government. Contacts from these engagements have now been shared.
It is highly recommended that PM&C send a formal letter to all state government Open
Government contacts inviting their input into the National Action Plan before requesting their
involvement in the delivery of specific actions.
Local government engagement
engage2 hoped to be able to work with Local Government Associations (LGAs). The
response to our engagement with Local Government Associations was mixed. It is
recommended that PM&C engage with these groups more formally perhaps before the draft
National Action Plan is released, then invite their support for implementation and promotion
of Open Government in LGAs more widely.
6. Informal engagement with and among stakeholders
To demonstrate it’s commitment to Open Government it is recommended that PM&C show
leadership and support for others delivering Open Government across Australia by:


Creating a unique online environment that enables:
o public reporting of progress against commitments and milestones outlined in
the National Action Plan
o promotion of opportunities to engage / have input / use data etc.
o stakeholders to engage and collaborate with each other, even forming online
communities of practice around topic areas if there is interest
o stakeholders to offer and request support for open government initiatives
o stakeholders to upload case studies
o the formal mechanism to engage with stakeholders and invite their input into
their processes; including meeting agendas, materials they develop and their
suggestions to Government
o opportunities to engage stakeholders in the self-assessment process or
throughout National Action Plan cycles
o methods to inform stakeholders about engagement for future National Action
Plan development
o the sharing of materials from the OGP and others around the world that are
supporting Government and stakeholders to deliver Open Government. For
example the Open Private Sector platform from the World Bank.
o links to the OGP website and databases of actions from other countries
o anyone to request involvement in events to talk about the OGP and Open
Government more generally
Creating a suite of materials about the OGP and Australia’s National Action Plan
that can be downloaded and shared by stakeholders with their networks. This might
include a presentation deck, input for newsletters, discussion points for events /
workshops, guidance for other levels of Government. It is highly recommended that
these materials also include some materials about Open Government actions and
benefits to specific industries and sectors e.g. how open data is being used for
Page 24 of 34 |collaborative impact and social outcomes in indigenous communities, the open
company’s initiatives and benefits and examples of how a transparency initiative is
affecting/potentially benefitting extractive industries.
 Run high profile open events mid-term with Open Government champions and
influencers from around the country and the world, for example the Open State
events being run in South Australia in October this year.
 Publishing and sharing contact details of stakeholders with others consent is
provided.
 Create a social media channel for the OGPAU project – it is an ongoing project that
requires updates and engagement.
 Ensure these activities are well resourced for ongoing content creation, community
management and engagement.
This type of approach will make self-assessment and engagement to develop future National
Action Plans easier for government. It will enable government to:
1. demonstrate openness, transparency and accountability of Government initiatives
2. keep stakeholders updated which will help to maintain trust
3. maintain up-to-date contact details of stakeholders, and skills and relationships that
can be leveraged for open government initiatives
4. stay across Open Government activities going on across Australia.
5. inform self-assessments and leverage stakeholder input into them
6. ensure understanding of stakeholders perception of Government initiatives and
interests so they do not come as a surprise through the independent review – this
will also help inform initiatives and priorities
7. build relationships among civil society and Government in preparation for the
co-creation of development of the next National Action Plan
7. Australia’s attendance at the OGP Summit
It is recommended that the Australian Government consider attending the OGP Summit to
be held in Paris in December 2016 to demonstrate its commitment to the Open Government
Partnership, build relationships with contact points in other countries and gain a deeper
understanding of commitments and processes.
8. Start engagement for the second National Action Plan earlier
Prepare now.
