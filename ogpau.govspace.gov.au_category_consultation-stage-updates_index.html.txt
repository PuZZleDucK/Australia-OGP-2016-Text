The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking
to further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other
interest groups over the course of August and September to finalise the
Australian Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open
Government Partnership (OGP) by the end of October 2016.

Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half
of 2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of
commitments that not only meet government and civil society’s
objectives, but also meet the core OGP requirement that the NAP be
developed publically and transparently in a spirit of genuine
partnership.

We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put
forward through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals
where appropriate.  It will also allow us to take account of the
outcomes from the United Kingdom Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016
and other countries NAPs as appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration
of the Plan.

Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these
consultations and engagement. We would welcome suggestions from
interested parties.

<div class="entry-content">

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for
Australia’s first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government.
Stakeholders from civil society and Government came together in Canberra
to discuss suggest actions, prioritise them and draft commitment
templates. It was momentous day. Our agenda was ambitious and the
results excellent. We were productive because of the goodwill and hard
work of those in the room.

I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants
in both civil society and government. The team leading development of
the NAP at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have
are pleased with the event, participation and the outputs generated.

**Participants in the co-creation workshop**\
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the
workshop. Participants included:

-   36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open
    Gov actions
-   4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
    Transformation
-   15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital
    Transformation Office; Department of Finance; National Archives;
    Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
-   1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
-   The Information Commissioner from NSW
-   2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
-   2 from State Governments
-   2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process

**Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates**\
Participants at the workshop discussed the [210 actions suggested by
civil society](../submissions/index.html) and those suggested by
agencies through the [InterDepartmental Committee
(IDC).](../../second-idc/index.html)Actions were grouped into 18
proposals which were then prioritised by participants and turned into 14
commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of the workshop and details of
attendees are available on [this page of the
wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=ace219a644fa786aeac66dd71aafacc1)

**What happens next?**\
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated
to lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the
NAP and these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP
before it is submitted to the OGP in July.

See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan [on this
wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667)

**Ongoing engagement for OGPAU**\
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might
be managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored
opportunities for ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have
been recorded on [this page of the
wiki,](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cbe9cf80d51d9a1742b8d0b6dd54d676)and
we would like to invite those of you not in the room to contribute to
this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a commitment
around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my
engagement report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so
we can use it in our recommendations.

**Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia**\
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support
Unit and I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government
across Australia. The [Australian Open Government Partnership
Network](https://opengovernment.org.au/) (civil society) also
coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government
in Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.

I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in
this process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C
and I have been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the
commitment you have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an
honour getting to know you all and learning more about your work.
Throughout this project I have been capturing [what I have learned about
Open Government in
Australia.](../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html#comment-373)
This input will also be included in my engagement report in late May. 
Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to
include.

To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance
Open Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details
with PM&C, the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams
coordinating Open Government in State Government, and others in Civil
Society keen to connect with you on this topic. If you would like to
provide consent for any or all of these uses of your personal
information, please complete [this 2 minute
survey](https://app.surveygizmo.com/builder/build/id/2719702) so I know
who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the 14th
May.

Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open
Government have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested
actions on the [wiki](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html). This
marks the end of [Stage 2 of our engagement
process](../../contribute/index.html), which was designed to raise
awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31^st^ March.

We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and
organisations. The level of investment of those who participated in this
process has been really impressive and the insight and experience of
participants is evident in the quality of submissions we received. There
is considerable passion and commitment to open government from our
community.

We have now commenced [Stage 3](../../contribute/index.html)of the
process to develop the National Action Plan (NAP) and are working with
those who suggested actions to prioritise them and draft the NAP
document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action have now
been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in Canberra
this Monday, the 11^th^ April 2016.

During this workshop participants will work together to develop the
National Action Plan, completing [commitment
templates](../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html){.broken_link}
provided by the international[Open Government
Partnership.](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)Representatives from
civil society and government agencies will discuss all suggested actions
so they can be grouped and prioritised. Two members of the International
Open Government Partnership Support Unit will also be at the workshop to
lend their support with this process.

This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC)
meeting to discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government
initiatives to include in the background section and build upon, and the
priorities of government agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the
workshop. On Wednesday, this
[wiki](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667)
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and
methodology sections of the National Action Plan document. A [blog
update](../updates/index.html) was also sent out by PM&C to share who
attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential commitments that the
Agencies have come up with in response to submissions received and from
their own research and analysis.

During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy
Secretary of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime
Minister and Cabinet and representatives of various Federal Government
Departments about how Open Government is being implemented in Australia
and government priorities for the NAP.

All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but
the National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a
suggested action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support
on Monday to co-create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to
brief nominated lead agencies about them after the event.

The agenda for this workshop is available
[here](../../files/2016/04/Agenda-cocreation-workshop.pdf). The opening
of this workshop will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 –
10:15am so you can see the opening and ask questions of our speakers.
[Here is the link to the GoogeHangout](https://t.co/TrhH6d1aZc)– a
public event anyone can attend online.

We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process
after the workshop next week.

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for
Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with
others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.

The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought
it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions
suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The
intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you
meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.

I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you
might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through
the wiki.

The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:

-   13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
-   14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
-   15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
-   16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity

The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:

-   12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
-   13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
-   14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
-   15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
-   17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU

I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at
the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.

I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st
between 11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an
action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.

I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next
meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60
actions have been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being
drafted.

I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in [Open Government Principles or the OGP Grand
Challenges](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration)
so they can help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest
actions.

The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or
organisations. 218 people have registered for updates, which is a 28%
increase since our January update, and I have emailed everyone on the
list to raise awareness about the project and encourage engagement. I
have personally discussed the project with 87 people, some who are
working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure there are many
more people and organisations across Australia who would be interested
in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a [one
page Introduction to the
OGPAU](../../files/2015/10/Introduction_to_OGPAU.pdf)document and [How
to Suggest an Action template with
tips](../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf) to support those
willing to help with this process. I am also happy to provide content
for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks – just let
me know how I can help.

I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local
Government Associations, and professional association, networks and
organisations with some interest in Open Government principles or the
Grand Challenges. I have been well received by teams delivering Open
Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still
trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory
so please do get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if
you know anyone there.

I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop
their ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to
date has said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own
organisations and networks for now. In response, I have sought out
opportunities to engage with existing networks and I am connecting
people with similar interests to each other directly. I have also
prepared a list of organisations I have been talking to, to share for
transparency and so you are aware of and can contact each other. I have
contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach whether this
requires your consent.

As an example, I have also connected several people interested in
transparency and open data for extractive industries, shared open
government platforms and ways to enable innovation within agencies and
innovation with others who want to help.

Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division [International Association for Public
Participation (IAP2)](https://www.iap2.org.au/) who sent out a
newsletter to their network and invited members to express an interest
in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement
Conference on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public
participation suggestions already put forward and try to generate more
suggestions for actions to include in the National Action Plan.
Collabforge has offered to do the same with attendees of the Engage2Act
conference in Melbourne and we are also exploring whether there is
enough interest in an event about collaboration and Open Gov. Toby has
been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data sector through a
series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in the Actions
you have inspired section of this post below.

I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership
and those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you
haven’t suggested an action or been in touch with me about your
interests please do so, so I can introduce you to others. I am also
happy to attend your events and workshop actions with you and others
with aligned interests.

Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so
far with Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in
the next draft of the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already
suggested an action please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest
in the project and PM&C can discuss suggestions with agencies. One
paragraph is fine for now. This [How to Suggest an
Action](../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf)document should
help, or you could look at the
[wiki](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=42b1a61b3db11a2a49c7002f630fa58c)
for ideas to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these
suggestions to determine which of these they will work with you to
workshop in April.

The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the
actions you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to
everyone who has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you
who have met with or made time to talk to me about the project and
others who may be interested. I’m really enjoying learning more about
Open Government in Australia. I thought you might too, so I have also
drafted this blog post about [What I have learned about Open Gov in
Australia](../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html)which
I will update as I continue to engage.

Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline

    teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with
    similar ideas
-   *Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups*
-   *Researching similar actions* outlined in Action Plans prepared by
    other countries
-   *Investigating privacy and consent requirements* for publishing
    stakeholder details – you may see an email from me asking if I can
    add your names to this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder
    list publicly.
-   *Researching ongoing engagement forums* being used in other
    Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership
    after action plans are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil
    society team, and some of the people involved in the NZ and the UK.
    Let me know if there are others you like.
-   *Researching OGP NAP review reports* to understand how Australia
    might be assessed and what actions should include.

Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to
discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open
Government initiatives inside Government across Australia.

I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC,
SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best
contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or
put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.

Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government
is being delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being
delivered within Australia as part of the international and National
Open Government movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.

    -   ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
    -   Open Data portal: <http://data.nsw.gov.au/>
    -   NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working
        with data analysts from University of Technology to generate
        insights from Government data:
        <https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-analytics-centre>
    -   Have your say:
        http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/search
    -   Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
        https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
    -   Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
        Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report
        on performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a
        culture of accountability by providing a single snapshot of real
        time data across NSW Government.
    -   Publish open government plans to showcase open government
        initiatives\
        NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
        report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
        collaboration, participation and innovation.
    -   Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
        community engagement through social media channels. This policy
        contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social
        media in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible,
        reliable and appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to
        ensure currency and include guidance on analytics and
        other tools.
    -   Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
        promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
        progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
        forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
        schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with
        government data.
    -   Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
        updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and
        prioritise data released in more open formats. [This policy was
        released
        on 26/4/16.](../../../www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/sites/default/files/resources/NSW_Government_Open_Data_Policy_2016.pdf)
    -   NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
        Management, which is now being used in two other Australian
        States through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of
        services is now generating revenue for the NSW.
    -   Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
        proactive release of open data, increase public participation
        and collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
        -   A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
            Data release guidelines.
        -   An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
            Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment
            and innovation in the area of information access. The Open
            Data Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
            data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
            (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
        -   Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
            implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative
            Commons licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets
            available to the public), all public documents (post
            June 2015) and the OEH website.
        -   Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
            methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
            that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
            through social media.
        -   Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
            drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government
            in OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to
            identify and train key staff who can help determine barriers
            and enablers for Open Government for the executive
            to consider. Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to
            devolve responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red
            tape and speed up approval for the release of open data.
        -   Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
            resource management programs such as the coastal
            reforms project.

**OGP engagement update – 1st March**\
*by Amelia Loye engage2*

It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister
and Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.

I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and
organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and
encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really
amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share
what I learn with you in this blog and email update.

You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action
Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement
strategy are now live on the
[website.](../../contribute/get-involved/index.html)

I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to
continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders
passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene
conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I
would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage
engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on
phone 0411960585 or by email at <amelia@engage2.com.au>.

**Engaging your networks:** I have been working with a range of
different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government
Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working
with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions
with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have
not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also
connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions
in areas that interest you through the International Open Government
Working Groups.

**Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:** The document is
being drafted [live](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)[on the
wiki](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html) so you can observe and
comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and
workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love
to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across
the Country.

**What’s happening with your input:** I collate all input received and
report back weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and
face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and
email submissions.

Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the
Open Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a
summary of your input to date.

As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki
so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal
submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as
they are received.

Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look
forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the
coming weeks.

The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to
flesh out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible
commitments, success criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to
monitor and track progress, and how we all go about creating a cohesive
open government approach for Australia. This feedback will be collated
and will feed into a draft NAP.

We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early
ideas for commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you
can work collaboratively with other consultation participants and the
national coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.

How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event** (14 December 2015 – 28
February 2016):

Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included
in an Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open
government. We also encourage you to explore the [<span
style="color: #0066cc">OGP
website</span>](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) including some of
the [<span style="color: #0066cc">actions plans from other
governments</span>](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries) and
keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute
to this stage by:

-   A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for
    you to contribute draft commitments and other content during this
    phase and to comment on other commitments proposed. Please
    contribute at
    [https://ogpau.wikispaces.com/](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)
-   A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to
    air ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of
    input to the consultation. Please subscribe to the [<span
    style="color: #0066cc">OGP Au mailing
    list</span>](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) to indicate your interest
    in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to present
    their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where and

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make
governments more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens.
To complete membership, the Australian Government will develop a
National Action Plan by the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP
timeline.

This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish
a vision for open government in Australia, defining the structure of the
Australian Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of
open government in Australia. The second stage of consultation will
focus on specific commitments.

How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History** (17 November 2015 – 11
December 2015):

A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision,
skeleton framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the
background/history of open government in Australia. We also encourage
you to explore the [OGP website](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
including some of the [actions plans from other
governments](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries). This is
Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:

-   Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1
    and 2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks.
    You can also indicate your interest by joining the [OGPau mailing
    list](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) and ticking the information sessions
    option, and we’ll notify you when they are open for registration.
-   Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
-   Adding feedback to the draft [Background
    page](../../background/index.html) comments.
-   Tweeting your thoughts to \#ogpau.
-   Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2
    as we need to get the framework right first.

See the [full consultation
timeline](../../national-action-plan/index.html) on the National Action
Plan Consultation page.

Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments
below for this stage. Please also find further information [About
OGP](../../about-ogp/index.html)..

We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the
contributions of others.

Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia
--------------------------------------------------

Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the
most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world.
However, there is always more that can be done. Please contribute your
thoughts in the comments below on what a future vision for open
government could look like in Australia. We will collate the input
into the wiki at the end of this stage.

A couple of example is provided to kick things off:

-   Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
    processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
-   Open government means citizens playing a greater part in
    policy development.

Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action
Plan. The [OGP National Action Plan
template](../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_actionplan_guide%20FINAL_0.pdf)
is available le online and a useful guide though most countries deviate
from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed are identical in
structure to the template. Please add your comments on this structure
below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will be
set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.

1.  **Introduction** – an overview of the Australian Government’s
    commitment, the grand challenges addressed in the NAP (*improved
    public services* and *more effectively managing public resources*)
2.  **Vision** – the vision for open government in Australia, looking
    forward
3.  **NAP Development Process** – the process of developing the
    Australian Government National Action Plan
4.  **Open Government Efforts to Date** – background of open government
    in Australia
5.  **Overview of commitments** – an overview of the commitments, then
    broken down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to
    identify which grand challenge they support, and which principles
    they support (see [NAP page on ogpau
    website](../../national-action-plan/index.html) for detail)
6.  **Conclusion** – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be
    supported

Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.

Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia
--------------------------------------------------------------

Please add your comments to the draft [Background
page](../../background/index.html) for any additional efforts to date.
