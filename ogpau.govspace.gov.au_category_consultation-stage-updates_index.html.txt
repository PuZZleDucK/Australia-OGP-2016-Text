****** OGP_Update_–_3_August ******
Posted on August_3,_2016  by  ogpteam

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking to
further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other interest
groups over the course of August and September to finalise the Australian
Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open Government Partnership
(OGP) by the end of October 2016.
Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half of
2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of commitments
that not only meet government and civil society’s objectives, but also meet the
core OGP requirement that the NAP be developed publically and transparently in
a spirit of genuine partnership.
We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put forward
through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals where appropriate. 
It will also allow us to take account of the outcomes from the United Kingdom
Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016 and other countries NAPs as
appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration of the Plan.
Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these consultations and
engagement. We would welcome suggestions from interested parties.

Posted on April_18,_2016  by  amelialoye

Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia’s
first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil
society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions,
prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our
agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of
the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.
I’ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both
civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) have are pleased with the
event, participation and the outputs generated.
Participants in the co-creation workshop
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop.
Participants included:
    * 36 from Civil Society – NGO’s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov
      actions
    * 4 from PM&C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and
      Transformation
    * 15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation
      Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry,
      Innovation and Science
    * 1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor’s Office
    * The Information Commissioner from NSW
    * 2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit
    * 2 from State Governments
    * 2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process
Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates
Participants at the workshop discussed the 210_actions_suggested_by_civil
society and those suggested by agencies through the InterDepartmental_Committee
(IDC).Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by
participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of
the workshop and details of attendees are available on this_page_of_the_wiki.
What happens next?
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the
workshop have now been taken by PM&C to executives in agencies nominated to
lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and
these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is
submitted to the OGP in July.
See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan on_this_wiki.
Ongoing engagement for OGPAU
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be
managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for
ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on this_page
of_the_wiki,and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to
contribute to this discussion. PM&C are using this information to develop a
commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the
coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement
report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in
our recommendations.
Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia
After Monday’s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and
I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across
Australia. The Australian_Open_Government_Partnership_Network (civil society)
also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing
engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in
Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.
I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this
process especially those of you involved in Monday’s event. PM&C and I have
been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you
have shown to Open Government in Australia. It’s been an honour getting to know
you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been
capturing what_I_have_learned_about_Open_Government_in_Australia. This input
will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know
if there is anything else you would like me to include.
To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open
Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&C,
the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open
Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect
with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of
these uses of your personal information, please complete this_2_minute_survey
so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the
14th May.

Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government
have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the wiki.
This marks the end of Stage_2_of_our_engagement_process, which was designed to
raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action
Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31st March.
We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations.
The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been
really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in
the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and
commitment to open government from our community.
We have now commenced Stage_3of the process to develop the National Action Plan
(NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and
draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action
have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in
Canberra this Monday, the 11th April 2016.
During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National
Action Plan, completing commitment_templates provided by the internationalOpen
Government_Partnership.Representatives from civil society and government
agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and
prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership
Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this
process.
This week PM&C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to
discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in
the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government
agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this wiki
page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology
sections of the National Action Plan document. A blog_update was also sent out
by PM&C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential
commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions
received and from their own research and analysis.
During Monday’s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary
of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open
Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the
NAP.
All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the
National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested
action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-
create a draft commitment template, PM&C has agreed to brief nominated lead
agencies about them after the event.
The agenda for this workshop is available here. The opening of this workshop
will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see
the opening and ask questions of our speakers. Here_is_the_link_to_the
GoogeHangout– a public event anyone can attend online.
We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the
workshop next week.

Posted on March_24,_2016  by  amelialoye

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of
      the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others
      you like.
    * Researching OGP NAP review reports to understand how Australia might be
      assessed and what actions should include.
Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss
your ideas and ways you might be more involved.

****** What_I’m_learning_about_Open_Gov_in_Australia ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available

                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
                  methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
                  that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
                  through social media.
                # Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
                  drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in
                  OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify
                  and train key staff who can help determine barriers and
                  enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider.
                  Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve
                  responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and
                  speed up approval for the release of open data.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.
Amelia Loye

Posted on December_14,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh

The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to flesh
out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible commitments, success
criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to monitor and track progress,
and how we all go about creating a cohesive open government approach for
Australia. This feedback will be collated and will feed into a draft NAP.
We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early ideas for
commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you can work
collaboratively with other consultation participants and the national
coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event (14 December 2015 – 28 February
2016):
Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included in an
Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open government.
We also encourage you to explore the OGP_website including some of the actions
plans_from_other_governments and keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action
plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for you to
      contribute draft commitments and other content during this phase and to
      comment on other commitments proposed. Please contribute at https://
      ogpau.wikispaces.com/
    * A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to air
      ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of input to
      the consultation. Please subscribe to the OGP_Au_mailing_list to indicate
      your interest in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to
      present their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where
      and when this forum will take place will be published on this website
      closer to the date.
    * You can add comments to this Stage 2 Blog post (below).
    * Tweet your thoughts to #ogpau.

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.
***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.
Pia Waugh (OGPau National Action Plan Coordinator, PM&C)
***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****
Please add your comments to the draft Background_page for any additional
efforts to date.
