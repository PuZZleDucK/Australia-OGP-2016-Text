****** What I’m learning about Open Gov in Australia ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye
I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available
                  to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the
                  OEH website.
                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
                  methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
                  that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
                  through social media.
                # Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
                  drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in
                  OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify
                  and train key staff who can help determine barriers and
                  enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider.
                  Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve
                  responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and
                  speed up approval for the release of open data.
                # Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
                  resource management programs such as the coastal reforms
                  project.

      The list appears comprehensive-ish, and forgive me if I have missed the
      mark when it comes to accessing government records, information and data.
      All jurisdictions will have an Records/Archives authority. Each of which
      provides access to records that are in jurisdictions open access period.
      Open access periods vary in each state and territory – but it still it is
      an opportunity and function that has been over-looked in this list.
      Federal/Commonwealth:
      National Archives of Australia – (and reading through the site, I have
      seen that they have provided some comment on some parts)
      Under the Archives Act 1983, the National Archives has two main roles:
      – to preserve Australia’s most valuable government records and encourage
      their use by the public; and
      – to promote good records management by Australian Government agencies.
      In fulfilling these responsibilities, we ensure that Australians have
      access to a national archival collection so they may better understand
      their heritage and democracy (taken directly from their website – about
      us)
      They have a records search function and also areading room which provides
      appropriate access to commonewealth held records to australian community.

      ACT:

      NSW:
      State Records NSW:

      WA:

      Open Government is a great initiative and there is so much opportunity to
      be reaped for the community at large by knowing the full complement of
      services available in accessing government records.
