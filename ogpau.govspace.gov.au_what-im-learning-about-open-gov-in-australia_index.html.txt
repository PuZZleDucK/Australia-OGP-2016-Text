<div class="entry-content">

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open
Government initiatives inside Government across Australia.

I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC,
SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best
contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or
put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.

Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government
is being delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being
delivered within Australia as part of the international and National
Open Government movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.

-   Open Gov in Queensland:
    -   Where to go for updates:
        http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
    -   Open Data portal: <https://data.qld.gov.au/>
    -   Queensland Globe:
        https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
    -   The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in
        Government (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/
        (internal for QLD Gov staff)

<!-- -->

-   Open Gov in NSW:
    -   Where to go for updates: <https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main>
    -   ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
    -   Open Data portal: <http://data.nsw.gov.au/>
    -   NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working
        with data analysts from University of Technology to generate
        insights from Government data:
        <https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-analytics-centre>
    -   Have your say:
        http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/search
    -   Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
        https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
    -   Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
        Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report
        on performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a
        culture of accountability by providing a single snapshot of real
        time data across NSW Government.
    -   Publish open government plans to showcase open government
        initiatives\
        NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
        report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
        collaboration, participation and innovation.
    -   Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
        community engagement through social media channels. This policy
        contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social
        media in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible,
        reliable and appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to
        ensure currency and include guidance on analytics and
        other tools.
    -   Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
        promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
        progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
        forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
        schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with
        government data.
    -   Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
        updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and
        prioritise data released in more open formats. [This policy was
        released
        on 26/4/16.](../../www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/sites/default/files/resources/NSW_Government_Open_Data_Policy_2016.pdf)
    -   NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
        Management, which is now being used in two other Australian
        States through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of
        services is now generating revenue for the NSW.
    -   Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
        proactive release of open data, increase public participation
        and collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
        -   A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
            Data release guidelines.
        -   An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
            Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment
            and innovation in the area of information access. The Open
            Data Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
            data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
            (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
        -   Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
            implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative
            Commons licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets
            available to the public), all public documents (post
            June 2015) and the OEH website.
        -   Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
            methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
            that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
            through social media.
        -   Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
            drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government
            in OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to
            identify and train key staff who can help determine barriers
            and enablers for Open Government for the executive
            to consider. Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to
            devolve responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red
            tape and speed up approval for the release of open data.
        -   Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
            resource management programs such as the coastal
            reforms project.

    The list appears comprehensive-ish, and forgive me if I have missed
    the mark when it comes to accessing government records, information
    and data.

    All jurisdictions will have an Records/Archives authority. Each of
    which provides access to records that are in jurisdictions open
    access period. Open access periods vary in each state and territory
    – but it still it is an opportunity and function that has been
    over-looked in this list.

    Federal/Commonwealth:\
    National Archives of Australia – (and reading through the site, I
    have seen that they have provided some comment on some parts)\
    Under the Archives Act 1983, the National Archives has two main
    roles:\
    – to preserve Australia’s most valuable government records and
    encourage their use by the public; and\

    agencies.\
    In fulfilling these responsibilities, we ensure that Australians

    understand their heritage and democracy (taken directly from their
    website – about us)

    provides appropriate access to commonewealth held records to
    australian community.\
