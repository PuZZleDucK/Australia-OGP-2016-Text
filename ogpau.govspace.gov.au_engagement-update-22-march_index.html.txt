We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia
on the
[wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=400b0cddf5e7a338daf5895375da5a64)Have
you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.

**Save the date!** Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to
help co-create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long
workshop on the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the
agencies most likely to lead actions. I will be in touch with those of
you who have suggested an action with more information. We know this
time frame is tight but it is necessary for us to meet Cabinet and OGP
timelines.

Need help? This [how to Suggest an Action document provides some
tips](../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf). It’s an easy
process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.

In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and
drafting on the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the
following themes:

-   [Engagement for
    OGP](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=3fd642b71c09fa7485cd3a6a758f861e)
-   [Fiscal
    Transparency](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=99b2404d03fa9b13d367b3703c0c7c24)
-   [Fostering
    Innovation](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=55b90e5fcfc1fb97879da6c1960853f5)
-   [Freedom of
    Information](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=d73cc4331ec3003755969fb7eb89fb91)
-   [Government
    Integrity](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=9211d09ec7bddeb1e90137c7569e4539)
-   [Open
    Data](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=803784c2b6224f9d18d6835ab8573341)
-   [Public
    Participation](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=e8dd8d8a0b329fb0e2567dbbd8da5d15)
-   [Public Service
    Delivery](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=b936a1c3c31d5ed972f656ca141b6501)
-   [Resources
    Management](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=9eb9944443db122f618ca0f8491dfff6)

We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on
each action suggested.

Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these
themes with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that
area. Many have also expressed excitement about the actions suggested
and several are keen to get involved. PM&C are now working with these
agencies to prepare them for the 11th April workshop.

Some questions that emerged during engagement last week
-------------------------------------------------------

-   After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what
    is the process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to
    look like?
-   How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside
    of the Grand Challenges?
-   What happened to the proposed teleconference?
-   How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?

**Responses to your questions**

*Cocreation –* The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those
suggesting actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet
Open Government team, but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in
Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra will be where civil society and
representatives from government agencies come together. Everyone who
suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can only be 5-15
actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host theme
based discussions to shape the OGP NAP [commitment
templates](../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html){.broken_link} with
you.

*Grand challenges –* The Government has made it clear the two Grand
Challenges are their focus, but they are willing to consider other
suggestions outside of these areas. At the workshop we will develop
commitments for all actions suggested, or groups of actions as we
prioritise and cluster them. Toby will share more about Government’s
position on this soon.

*Teleconference –* I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an
action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so
you can meet others who have suggested actions within the same themes,
to discuss similarities, differences and priorities before the 11th
April event.

*Working together to prioritise actions* – We need to work together to
prioritise suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them
down. I’d like to help you / civil society / us, to start discussing
that now before the workshop on the 11th April. There are two ways you
can get involved in this process:

-   Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
    discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how
    they might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage
    your involvement.
-   In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you
    who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on
    the 29th or 30th March, to introduce you to others with similar
    suggestions, so we can discuss your ideas and priorities before the
    11th April event.

Actions that you have inspired me to take
-----------------------------------------

Based on your input to date I am now:

-   *Encouraging theme based engagement* – I will be running
    teleconferences with those who have suggested actions under a theme.
    If you have suggested an action, you will receive a separate email
    from me about this.
-   *Encouraging feedback from others on actions –* *actions have now
    been themed into groups with each posted as a discussion point on
    the wiki. We are looking for your thoughts about similarities,
    differences and opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow
    down and prioritise with you at the workshop.*
-   *Connecting Australians to the* *[working
    groups](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups)*
    *and Open Government Partnership Support Unit,* *Regional Civil
    Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
    <shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org>*
-   *Investigating privacy and consent requirements* for publishing
    stakeholder details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
-   *Researching ongoing engagement forums* being used in other
    Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership
    after action plans are developed. I have discussed my initial
    thoughts with the Australian Open Government Partnership Networks.

Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and
will include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.

Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you
might be more involved.
