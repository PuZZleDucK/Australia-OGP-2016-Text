****** Engagement update – 22 March ******
Posted on March_23,_2016  by  amelialoye
We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the
wiki.Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.
Save the date! Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-
create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on
the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to
lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action
with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for
us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.
Need help? This how_to_Suggest_an_Action_document_provides_some_tips. It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.
In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on
the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:
    * Engagement_for_OGP
    * Fiscal_Transparency
    * Fostering_Innovation
    * Freedom_of_Information
    * Government_Integrity
    * Open_Data
    * Public_Participation
    * Public_Service_Delivery
    * Resources_Management
We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each
action suggested.
Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these themes
with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have
also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to
get involved. PM&C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the
11th April workshop.
***** Some questions that emerged during engagement last week *****
    * After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the
      process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?
    * How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of
      the Grand Challenges?
    * What happened to the proposed teleconference?
    * How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?
Responses to your questions
Cocreation – The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting
actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team,
but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra
will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come
together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can
only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host
theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP commitment_templates with you.
Grand challenges – The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges
are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of
these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions
suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will
share more about Government’s position on this soon.
Teleconference –I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to
invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others
who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities,
differences and priorities before the 11th April event.
Working together to prioritise actions – We need to work together to prioritise
suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to
help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop
on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:
    * Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
      discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they
      might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.
    * In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you who
      have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or
      30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we
      can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.
***** Actions that you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Encouraging theme based engagement– I will be running teleconferences
      with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have
      suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about
      this.
    * Encouraging feedback from others on actions –actions have now been themed
      into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are
      looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and
      opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise
      with you at the workshop.
    * Connecting Australians to theworking_groupsand Open Government
      Partnership Support Unit,Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
      shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Networks.
Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will
include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might
be more involved.
