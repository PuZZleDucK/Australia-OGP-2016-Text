		<description><![CDATA[I have been running a survey over the past months of attitudes and concerns regarding transparency and accountability in Australia. The survey asks people to tick their concerns, share the tools and resources the use to investigate accountability issues and also offer their own ideas for how to improve transparency in Australia. 
The overview is at https://infoaus.net/openaus/ideas.php
Results for individual questions can be found at https://infoaus.net/openaus/survey.php]]></description>
