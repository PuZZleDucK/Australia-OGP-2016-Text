The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pleased to announce
the members of the Interim Working Group for Australia’s Open Government
Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan. The Group is comprised of six
government and six non-government members, keeping with the
collaborative spirit of the OGP.

The civil society representatives were selected from an extremely
competitive field, reflecting the deep level of ongoing public
engagement with Australia’s process to join the OGP. They bring a wide
breadth of experience across a range of fields relevant to open
government, and represent a diverse range of interests and sectors.

Meet the civil society representatives:

-   **Ms Fiona McLeod SC (co-chair):** Fiona is the President-elect of
    the Law Council of Australia and has also previously served as the
    President of the Australian Bar Association, as Chair of the
    Victorian Bar, and as a member of the Law Council Executive Board.
    Fiona brings considerable leadership experience to her role as
    co-chair, and substantial experience working with government,
    corporate and non-government sectors. The Law Council engages
    closely in parliamentary and public sector reform processes related
    to transparency and strengthening the integrity of public offices.
-   **The Hon. Dr Ken Coghill**: Ken is an Associate Professor at Monash
    University with research and teaching interests in government
    accountability and governance. He is also a former Member of
    Parliament in Victoria, and Deputy Chair and Treasurer of the
    Accountability Round Table, which advocates for transparency as a
    key factor of accountability. Ken has written extensively on
    Commonwealth, State and Territory government accountability and
    parliamentary reforms.
-   **Mr Mark Zirnsak:** Mark is the Director of the Social Justice Unit
    of the Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Uniting Church in Australia.
    In this role, he has advocated for transparency, accountability and
    open government, including through his involvement in Publish What
    You Pay Australia, Transparency International Australia and as a
    member of the Secretariat for the Tax Justice Network in Australia.
-   **Ms Maree Adshead:** Maree is the CEO of the Open Data Institute
    Queensland, a node of the international Open Data Institute. She has
    held a number of industry representative roles, including as past
    Chair of the Technology Council of the Chamber of Commerce and
    Industry Queensland, and past Chair of the Australian Information
    Industry Association Queensland. ODI Queensland promotes the release
    of public data to increase accountability, improve efficiencies, and
    to drive technological innovation.
-   **Mr Peter Timmins:** Peter is the Interim Convener of the OGP Civil
    Society Network, a coalition of civil society organisations and
    individuals committed to making government work better through
    transparency, participation and accountability. He also has
    considerable experience engaging with freedom of information and
    privacy laws, including as a member of the Australian Law Reform
    Commission Advisory Committee for the Inquiry into Secrecy Laws and
    Open Government in Australia, and the NSW Information and Privacy
    Advisory Committee.
-   **Ms Katherine Szuminska:** Kat is the Co-Founder and Director of
    the OpenAustralia Foundation and also sits on the Steering Committee
    of the OGP Civil Society Network. The OpenAustralia Foundation uses
    technologies and tools to encourage public participation in the
    political process, and to advocate for more transparency and
    accountability in government. Kat has a strong knowledge of the OGP,
    having been involved in various international OGP events.

Meet the government representatives:

-   **Dr Steven Kennedy (co-chair):** Deputy Secretary, Innovation &
    Transformation, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
-   **Dr Stein Helgeby**: Deputy Secretary, Governance & APS
    Transformation, Department of Finance.
-   **Mr Iain Anderson:** Deputy Secretary, Civil Justice and Corporate
    Group, Attorney-General’s Department.
-   **Ms Meghan Quinn:** Division Head, Financial System Division, The
    Treasury
-   **Mr Timothy Pilgrim**: Australian Privacy Commissioner and Acting
    Australian Information Commissioner.
-   **Ms Anne Lyons**: Assistant Director-General, Government
    Information Assurance & Policy, National Archives of Australia.

The NSW Information Commissioner, **Ms Elizabeth Tydd** will also be a
non-voting jurisdictional member, reflecting the Commonwealth’s desire
to build stronger relationships with the states on open government
matters.

Thank you once again to everyone who submitted an expression of
interest. The Interim Working Group will be continuing to engage with
all interested stakeholders as they work to co-draft Australia’s first
National Action Plan. We invite you to [sign
up](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) to the mailing list for updates, and stay
tuned to this blog for meeting agendas, meeting minutes and other
details of the Interim Working Group’s progress.

**Selection process**

The submission period closed at 5pm AEST on 24 August 2016 and PM&C
received around 40 expressions of interest for the civil society
positions on the Interim Working Group. In parallel, PM&C invited senior
executives from key agencies to represent the Government on the Interim
Working Group.

PM&C assessed all submissions received according to the criteria in the
call for expressions of interest. Candidates were shortlisted and ranked
by suitability against these criteria, which included their experience
and expertise in open government and open data, and their experience in
engaging with stakeholders and/or government.

We strived for a diversity of civil society representatives, and the
applicants were assessed with regards to breadth and diversity against a
number of factors (e.g. demographics, geographical region, access to a
variety of sectors and indusry, engagement on OGP issues, and relevant
skills). The selected civil society representatives provide a good mix
of experience across the spectrum of open government issues, and bring a
wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.

The OGP project team contacted all applicants with the outcome of their
expression of interest on 29 August 2016. All applicants are welcome to
contact <OGP@pmc.gov.au> for feedback on their application.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is calling for
stakeholder expressions of interest to join an Interim Working Group to
help co-draft Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government
Partnership (OGP).

The Interim Working Group will build upon the civil society
consultations conducted from December 2015 to April 2016. Proposed
commitments submitted by stakeholders can be accessed
[here](../../../../files/2016/08/Australias-National-Action-Plan-Stocktake-of-commitments.pdf)**.**

The Interim Working Group will consider and prioritise commitments for
possible inclusion in the draft National Action Plan which will be
considered by the Government before its submission to the OGP by 1
November 2016.

A draft Terms of Reference setting out the role of the Interim Working
Group and arrangements for membership can be accessed
[here.](../../../../files/2016/08/Interim-Working-Group-Draft-ToR_FINAL.docx)
The draft Terms of Reference will be considered by the Interim Working
Group at its first meeting.

This will be Australia’s first National Action Plan. It is intended to
provide a foundation to further engage with civil society and identify
new initiatives over time that will strengthen transparency,
accountability and public participation in government.

**Process**

The Interim Working Group is expected to have up to 12 members. It will
comprise equal representation of government officials and a range of
civil society stakeholders.

EOIs must outline relevant experience and expertise related to
supporting transparency, accountability and open government. The Interim
Working Group will be co-chaired by a senior government official and a
civil society representative. Please indicate in your EOI if you are
interested in co-chairing the Working Group.

Candidates must be available over August-September 2016 and must be able
to attend:

-   a minimum of 3 tele/videoconference meetings; and
-   a face-to-face workshop (date and location TBC).

Remuneration will not be provided. If required, government will work
with civil society groups to help cover travel costs and associated
expenses for the workshop.

In assessing EOIs for members and co-chair, PM&C will consider:

-   the breadth and diversity of representatives (across demographics,
    geographic regions, and access to a variety of sectors and
    industries);
-   experience in open government, using open data and engaging with
    stakeholders and/or government; and
-   for co-chairs, experience in chairing similar groups.

EOIs should be no more than one page in length and be submitted via
email to <ogp@pmc.gov.au> by **5pm on Wednesday, 24 August 2016.**

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) will be seeking
to further engage with the public, civil society organisations and other
interest groups over the course of August and September to finalise the
Australian Government’s 2016 National Action Plan (NAP) to the Open
Government Partnership (OGP) by the end of October 2016.

Building on the consultations and work that took place in the first half
of 2016, we are eager to continue working together to settle a set of
commitments that not only meet government and civil society’s
objectives, but also meet the core OGP requirement that the NAP be
developed publically and transparently in a spirit of genuine
partnership.

We hope to use this process to jointly review the key proposals put
forward through the initial workshops and to identify new proposals
where appropriate.  It will also allow us to take account of the
outcomes from the United Kingdom Anti‑Corruption Summit held in May 2016
and other countries NAPs as appropriate, to raise the overall aspiration
of the Plan.

Further details will be provided shortly on the form of these
consultations and engagement. We would welcome suggestions from
interested parties.

and other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy
to read, in line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is
available for download at [National Action Plan DRAFT v5 – For
Release](../../../../files/2016/04/National-Action-Plan-DRAFT-v5-For-Release.docx)

We have also posted the text onto the wiki at

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for
Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with
others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.

The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought
it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions
suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The
intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you
meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.

I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you
might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through
the wiki.

The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:

-   13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
-   14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
-   15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
-   16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity

The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:

-   12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
-   13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
-   14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
-   15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
-   17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU

I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at
the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.

I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st
between 11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an
action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.

I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next
meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia
on the
[wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=400b0cddf5e7a338daf5895375da5a64)Have
you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.

**Save the date!** Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to
help co-create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long
workshop on the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the
agencies most likely to lead actions. I will be in touch with those of
you who have suggested an action with more information. We know this
time frame is tight but it is necessary for us to meet Cabinet and OGP
timelines.

Need help? This [how to Suggest an Action document provides some
tips](../../../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf). It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions
of my own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.

In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and
drafting on the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the
following themes:

-   [Engagement for

    Management](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=0e3314c1b29a0cbe2e92cf0f9a3dd95b8)

We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on
each action suggested.

Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these
themes with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that
area. Many have also expressed excitement about the actions suggested
and several are keen to get involved. PM&C are now working with these
agencies to prepare them for the 11th April workshop.

Some questions that emerged during engagement last week
-------------------------------------------------------

-   After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what
    is the process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to
    look like?
-   How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside
    of the Grand Challenges?
-   What happened to the proposed teleconference?
-   How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?

**Responses to your questions**

*Cocreation –* The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those
suggesting actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet
Open Government team, but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in
Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra will be where civil society and
representatives from government agencies come together. Everyone who
suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can only be 5-15
actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host theme
based discussions to shape the OGP NAP [commitment
templates](../../../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html){.broken_link} with
you.

*Grand challenges –* The Government has made it clear the two Grand
Challenges are their focus, but they are willing to consider other
suggestions outside of these areas. At the workshop we will develop
commitments for all actions suggested, or groups of actions as we
prioritise and cluster them. Toby will share more about Government’s
position on this soon.

*Teleconference –* I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an
action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so
you can meet others who have suggested actions within the same themes,
to discuss similarities, differences and priorities before the 11th
April event.

*Working together to prioritise actions* – We need to work together to
prioritise suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them
down. I’d like to help you / civil society / us, to start discussing
that now before the workshop on the 11th April. There are two ways you
can get involved in this process:

-   Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
    discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how
    they might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage
    your involvement.
-   In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you
    who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on
    the 29th or 30th March, to introduce you to others with similar
    suggestions, so we can discuss your ideas and priorities before the
    11th April event.

Actions that you have inspired me to take
-----------------------------------------

Based on your input to date I am now:

-   *Encouraging theme based engagement* – I will be running
    teleconferences with those who have suggested actions under a theme.
    If you have suggested an action, you will receive a separate email
    from me about this.
-   *Encouraging feedback from others on actions –* *actions have now
    been themed into groups with each posted as a discussion point on
    the wiki. We are looking for your thoughts about similarities,
    differences and opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow
    down and prioritise with you at the workshop.*
-   *Connecting Australians to the* *[working
    groups](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups)*
    *and Open Government Partnership Support Unit,* *Regional Civil
    Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
    <shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org>*
-   *Investigating privacy and consent requirements* for publishing
    stakeholder details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
-   *Researching ongoing engagement forums* being used in other
    Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership
    after action plans are developed. I have discussed my initial
    thoughts with the Australian Open Government Partnership Networks.

Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and
will include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.

Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you
might be more involved.
