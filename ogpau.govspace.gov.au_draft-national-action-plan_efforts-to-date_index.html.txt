<div class="entry-content">

The Australian Government has already taken a range of steps towards
improving transparency, integrity and anti‑corruption in recent years,
which this National Action Plan will build upon.

Open data and digital transformation of government services are high
priorities for the Government and considerable progress has been made in
a short space of time.

-   The **Public Data Policy Statement**, released in December 2015,
    commits Australian Government entities to release non-sensitive data
    as open by default. Since 2013, the number of discoverable resources
    on data.gov.au has grown from approximately 500 to over 20,000.
-   The **Digital Transformation Agency** (formerly the Digital
    Transformation Office) has been established to lead the online
    transformation of government services, and provide an integrated
    policy and strategic capability for whole of government ICT, ICT
    procurement and digital. The Digital Transformation Agency will
    implement wide scale change in digital capability across government
    departments, benefiting the public and other users of
    government services.

There have been several major initiatives to improve accountability and
integrity both within and outside of government.

-   The Government commissioned an **independent review of the
    parliamentary entitlements system** in August 2015, and has given
    its in-principle support to all of the recommendations of
    the review.
-   The **Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption**
    reported in December 2015. The Government has introduced legislation
    to improve the governance and accountability of registered
    organisations (unions and employer organisations).

Steps have been taken to make government procurement more transparent,
and to encourage innovation by making it easier for start-ups and
innovative small businesses to sell services to government.

-   The National Innovation and Science Agenda committed to establish a
    new **Digital Marketplace** for procuring ICT products and services,
    and seeking innovative solutions to policy and service delivery
    “challenges” through the **Business Research and Innovation
    Initiative**.
-   A public **ICT dashboard** is being developed to improve
    transparency around Government ICT performance and progress on major
    new investments.

The Australian Government has also been active (and in many cases a
leader) in international anti‑corruption and tax avoidance /
transparency efforts.

-   Australia is a key member of the **G20 Anti-Corruption Working
    Group**, having led the development of the G20 Anti‑Corruption
    Action Plan and the subsequent 2015-16 Anti‑Corruption
    Implementation Plan. The G20 High Level Principles on Beneficial
    Ownership Transparency are also a legacy item of Australia’s 2014
    G20 presidency.
-   Australia was also an active participant in the **UK’s international
    anti-corruption summit** in London in May 2016. At the meeting, the
    Government endorsed the Global Declaration against Corruption and
    announced a range of new measures, including joining the Extractive
    Industries Transparency Initiative and holding an annual government
    business roundtable on corruption.
-   In December 2015, the Australian Taxation Office published the first
    annual ***Report of Entity Tax Information****,* which included the
    Australian total income, taxable income and tax paid of large public
    and private companies operating in Australia.
-   The **Voluntary Tax Transparency Code**, announced as part of the
    2016-17 Budget, is a set of principles and minimum standards to
    guide medium and large businesses on public disclosure of
    tax information. Adoption of the Code is voluntary, and is designed
    to encourage greater transparency within the corporate sector.

These new measures build on other actions taken over the last decade to
improve access to government information and promote transparency and
integrity at the federal level:

-   Whistle-blower protections in the public sector were significantly
    improved by the *Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013*, which
    commenced in January 2014.
-   Freedom of information laws were reformed in 2010, and included the
    introduction of the Information Publication Scheme (IPS), which
    requires Australian Government agencies to publish a broad range of
    information on their websites.
-   The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner was
    established in 2010 to promote access to government information.
-   The *Archives Act 1983* was amended in 2010 to reduce the period
    before which government information and Cabinet documents are
    released. A Digital Transition Policy and Digital Continuity 2020
    Policy have also been established, requiring government information
    to be created and managed digitally.
-   Creative Commons licensing was adopted in 2010 to accommodate access
    to government information and bring consistency to
    licensing arrangements.

State, territory and local governments have also undertaken a range of
initiatives to promote transparency, integrity and access to information
at a sub-national level.
