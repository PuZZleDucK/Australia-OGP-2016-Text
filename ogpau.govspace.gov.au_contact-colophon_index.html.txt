Accessibility
The OGP Au blog aims to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) web standard, endorsed by the
Australian Government.
The majority of content on this blog is text based. Images have alternative
text and are often described further in surrounding information.
This website is developed on the content management system, WordPress with a
customised GovSpace template specifically built to meet Australian Government
publishing requirements including accessibility. Providing access to
information for all users, including those with a disability, is of paramount
importance to us. If there is information on this site in a format you cannot
access or if you experience any other accessibility difficulties, please
contact_us.

all material presented in this blog is provided under a Creative_Commons
Attribution_3.0_Australia licence. The details of the relevant licence
conditions are available on the Creative Commons website (accessible using the
links provided) as is the full_legal_code_for_the_CC_BY_3.0_AU_licence. The

When you submit a comment to this website, you retain copyright in it. By
submitting a comment to this website you agree to make it available to the rest
of the world under the same Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia licence
as above. If you have made a comment unaware of this policy and you are unhappy
about it, please contact_us and we can remove your comment from our system.

***** Moderation policy and process *****
We don’t want to hinder any conversations that are taking place on this blog.
The moderation process helps ensure that spam or comments that breach the terms
of use (below) are not published. We aim to publish most comments immediately.
To help us do this, please make sure:
    * Your comments are relevant or on-topic;
    * Your comments are not inflammatory, unreasonable or obscene;
    * You are civil and respectful of others and their opinions (including not
      impersonating anyone and not posting someone’s personal information
      without their permission); and
    * Your behaviour is in line with relevant laws.
This blog uses a post-moderation process: your comment is basically published
immediately – after going through some automated system checks.
The first is a human verification step to deter spam bots: when you submit a
comment, you are asked to include a user name and an email address. You don’t
have to include your actual details; you may post under a pseudonym.
Offensive language is automatically checked by the system and comments with
many links in them may be automatically held for moderation (links being a
major part of most comment spam). Comments being held in the system are
manually checked by a moderator to determine if the comment should be
published, edited or deleted. The same manual process is applied to a published
comment found to have breached the terms of use. If a comment is edited, we
will include a reference so you can tell.
In most cases, we’ll close comments on posts after 3 months. This is primarily
to block spam comments from appearing on older posts; if you wish to provide
feedback on or discuss an older post, please let us know.
If we make a mistake, again please let us know and we will deal with it as
quickly as we can.
