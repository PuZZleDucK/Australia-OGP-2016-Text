**Accessibility**

The OGP Au blog aims to meet the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) web standard, endorsed
by the Australian Government.

The majority of content on this blog is text based. Images have
alternative text and are often described further in surrounding
information.

This website is developed on the content management system,
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) with a customised
[GovSpace](https://govspace.gov.au/) template specifically built to meet
Australian Government publishing requirements including accessibility.
Providing access to information for all users, including those with a
disability, is of paramount importance to us. If there is information on
this site in a format you cannot access or if you experience any other
accessibility difficulties, please [contact

<span id="Moderation_policy_and_process">Moderation policy and process</span> {#disclaimer}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We don’t want to hinder any conversations that are taking place on this
blog. The moderation process helps ensure that spam or comments that
breach the terms of use (below) are not published. We aim to publish
most comments immediately. To help us do this, please make sure:

-   Your comments are relevant or on-topic;
-   Your comments are not inflammatory, unreasonable or obscene;
-   You are civil and respectful of others and their opinions (including
    not impersonating anyone and not posting someone’s personal
    information without their permission); and
-   Your behaviour is in line with relevant laws.

This blog uses a post-moderation process: your comment is basically
published immediately – after going through some automated system
checks.

The first is a human verification step to deter spam bots: when you
submit a comment, you are asked to include a user name and an email
address. You don’t have to include your actual details; you may post
under a pseudonym.

Offensive language is automatically checked by the system and comments
with many links in them may be automatically held for moderation (links
being a major part of most comment spam). Comments being held in the
system are manually checked by a moderator to determine if the comment
should be published, edited or deleted. The same manual process is
applied to a published comment found to have breached the terms of use.
If a comment is edited, we will include a reference so you can tell.

In most cases, we’ll close comments on posts after 3 months. This is
primarily to block spam comments from appearing on older posts; if you
wish to provide feedback on or discuss an older post, please let us
know.

If we make a mistake, again please let us know and we will deal with it
as quickly as we can.
