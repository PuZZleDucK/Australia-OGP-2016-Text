<div class="entry-content">

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60
actions have been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being
drafted.

I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in [Open Government Principles or the OGP Grand
Challenges](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration)
so they can help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest
actions.

The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or
organisations. 218 people have registered for updates, which is a 28%
increase since our January update, and I have emailed everyone on the
list to raise awareness about the project and encourage engagement. I
have personally discussed the project with 87 people, some who are
working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure there are many
more people and organisations across Australia who would be interested
in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a [one
page Introduction to the
OGPAU](../files/2015/10/Introduction_to_OGPAU.pdf)document and [How to
Suggest an Action template with
tips](../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf) to support those
willing to help with this process. I am also happy to provide content
for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks – just let
me know how I can help.

I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local
Government Associations, and professional association, networks and
organisations with some interest in Open Government principles or the
Grand Challenges. I have been well received by teams delivering Open
Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still
trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory
so please do get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if
you know anyone there.

I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop
their ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to
date has said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own
organisations and networks for now. In response, I have sought out
opportunities to engage with existing networks and I am connecting
people with similar interests to each other directly. I have also
prepared a list of organisations I have been talking to, to share for
transparency and so you are aware of and can contact each other. I have
contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach whether this
requires your consent.

As an example, I have also connected several people interested in
transparency and open data for extractive industries, shared open
government platforms and ways to enable innovation within agencies and
innovation with others who want to help.

Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division [International Association for Public
Participation (IAP2)](https://www.iap2.org.au/) who sent out a
newsletter to their network and invited members to express an interest
in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement
Conference on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public
participation suggestions already put forward and try to generate more
suggestions for actions to include in the National Action Plan.
Collabforge has offered to do the same with attendees of the Engage2Act
conference in Melbourne and we are also exploring whether there is
enough interest in an event about collaboration and Open Gov. Toby has
been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data sector through a
series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in the Actions
you have inspired section of this post below.

I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership
and those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you
haven’t suggested an action or been in touch with me about your
interests please do so, so I can introduce you to others. I am also
happy to attend your events and workshop actions with you and others
with aligned interests.

Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so
far with Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in
the next draft of the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already
suggested an action please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest
in the project and PM&C can discuss suggestions with agencies. One
paragraph is fine for now. This [How to Suggest an
Action](../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf)document should
help, or you could look at the
[wiki](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cc5e5d1fa2e5184eaee6859f30c7c791)
for ideas to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these
suggestions to determine which of these they will work with you to
workshop in April.

The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the
actions you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to
everyone who has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you
who have met with or made time to talk to me about the project and
others who may be interested. I’m really enjoying learning more about
Open Government in Australia. I thought you might too, so I have also
drafted this blog post about [What I have learned about Open Gov in
Australia](../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html)which
I will update as I continue to engage.

Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline
-----------------------------------------------------

My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key
*themes:*

-   *Public Participation* –increased input into both policy and agenda
    setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
-   *Government Integrity* – procurement, political donations,
    anti-corruption, parliamentary openness
-   *Freedom of Information* – review of the act, role of the
    commissioners, privacy, copyright review

    data, publishing practices for data and publications including
    natural resource and extractive industry data
-   *Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency* –

-   *Fostering innovation* – enabling and delivering innovation within
    Gov given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models
    that deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver
    outputs, support small to medium size businesses to use open data
    and deliver services
-   *Engagement for OGP* – raising awareness now, engaging the States,
    forums for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff

Actions you have inspired me to take
------------------------------------

Based on your input to date I am now:

-   *Supporting* a number of organisations with development of their
    submissions
-   *Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills*
    – e.g. My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for
    Australia; and the author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared
    platform to teams wanting to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria.
    Professionals working with data for natural resource management and
    sustainability programs. Individuals to the International OGP
    Working Groups.
-   *Co-hosting events* – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about
    public participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at
    Engage2Act in Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the
    Ark Conference for Community. Engagement. I have also offered to
    host events with a number of the organisations listed.
-   *Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference –* will now be a
    teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with
    similar ideas
-   *Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups*
-   *Researching similar actions* outlined in Action Plans prepared by
    other countries
-   *Investigating privacy and consent requirements* for publishing
    stakeholder details – you may see an email from me asking if I can
    add your names to this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder
    list publicly.
-   *Researching ongoing engagement forums* being used in other
    Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership
    after action plans are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil
    society team, and some of the people involved in the NZ and the UK.
    Let me know if there are others you like.
-   *Researching OGP NAP review reports* to understand how Australia
    might be assessed and what actions should include.

Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to
discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.
