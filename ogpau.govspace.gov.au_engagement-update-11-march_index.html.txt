****** Engagement update – 11 March ******
Posted on March_11,_2016  by  amelialoye
Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of
      the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others
      you like.
    * Researching OGP NAP review reports to understand how Australia might be
      assessed and what actions should include.
Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss
your ideas and ways you might be more involved.
