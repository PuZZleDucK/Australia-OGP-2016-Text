***** What is “open government”? *****
Open government means different things to different people. Many countries
around the world are working on open government initiatives, each initiative
being defined differently and tailored to the needs of that country’s citizens
and government.
For the Open Government Partnership, it is the goal that governments will
“become sustainably more transparent, more accountable and more responsive to
their own citizens, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of
governance, as well as the quality of services that citizens receive.”
At the heart of open government are the ideas of transparency, participation
and accountability. As a working definition;
    * Transparency means the public understands the workings of their
      government
    * Participation means public can influence the workings of government by
      engaging with public policy processes and public service providers
    * Accountability means the public can hold the government to account for
      its policy and service delivery performance
Citizen engagement is what open government is all about. It underpins many of
the other topics in this guide – with active citizenship often being a vital
link between transparency and accountability. The Open Government Partnership
recognises this in its eligibility criteria, stating that: ‘Open Government
requires openness to citizen participation and engagement in policymaking and
governance, including basic protections for civil liberties’ (Open Government
Partnership).
***** What is the Open Government Partnership? *****
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) was launched in 2011 to provide an
international platform for domestic reformers to implement ambitious open
government reforms based on a number of commitments to make their governments
more open, accountable, responsive to citizens. Since then, OGP has grown from
8 countries to the 69 participating countries. In all of these countries,
government and civil society are working together to develop and implement
ambitious open government reforms based on a number of commitments to make
their governments more open and accountable. For more information visit the
Open_Government_Partnership website
***** What do countries need to do to be eligible to join the OGP? How many
meet these criteria? *****
To participate in OGP, governments must show a demonstrated commitment to open
government in four key areas – fiscal transparency, access to information,
disclosure of income and assets of elected or senior public officials and
citizen engagement. These are measured by objective indicators and validated by
independent experts.
In order to participate in OGP, countries must score at least 75% of the total
possible points available to them across the areas that are relevant to them.
Once countries have joined OGP, they are regularly assessed to ensure they
continue to abide by their commitments and their performance measures are up to
date.
Over 70 per cent of those countries which are eligible to join the OGP have
done so (based on 57 of 81 nations). Australia is considered eligible to join
and has now committed to finalising membership.
***** How does a country join OGP? *****
There are three requirements to join OGP:
    * making a commitment to the OGP Declaration of Open Government, which
      aligns with existing Australian Government policy and practice (ref http:
      //www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration);
    * developing a publicly consulted National Action Plan by July 2016 to
      submit to OGP with between 5-15 commitments that align to at least one of
      the five OGP “grand challenges”; and
    * undertaking an annual independent reporting of progress on the National
      Action Plan conducted by the Independent Reporting Mechanism of the OGP
      (ref http://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm).
More information can be located here: http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-
works/requirements
***** Can countries be expelled from the OGP once they become members? *****
Once a country’s action plan has been agreed, progress is monitored by both
other nations and civil society organisations, as well as by the Independent
Review_Mechanism_(IRM), to ensure all its promises are met. This independent
international expert group of the IRM will inform the Steering Committee if
they suspect a country as falling below the minimum eligibility criteria. The
Steering Committee can then review the participation of said governments. In
addition, governments are also being held accountable by civil society and
media in their countries and if they perform poorly in three successive
reports, participation can be reviewed.
***** How is OGP managed? *****
OGP is overseen by a multi-stakeholder international Steering_Committeethat
currently includes nine governments and nine leading civil society
representatives. The Steering Committee serves as OGP’s key executive
management body. The Steering Committee is led by a government chair, a
supporting (or incoming) government co-chair, and two civil society co-chairs.
More information on the OGP Steering Committee can be found here.
***** How does Australian intend to consult with the public? *****
The Open_Government_Partnership (OGP) requires broad consultation for the
development of member countries’ National Action Plans (NAP). This provides the
public, civil society, and the private sector with the opportunity to
participate in the process, and suggest commitments for governments to
undertake.
As described in the consultation process timeline below, the Government will
use the prioritised public-suggested commitments to guide the development of a
draft NAP. Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of what
will improve public services and improve management of public resources, as
well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities for business and
support innovation in Australia.
We look forward to your contributions to the consultation and public
discussions. We encourage you to contribute throughout the process and, as this
is a public consultation process, we prefer all contributions to be made
publicly for transparency and peer review.
***** What is the criteria for developing a national action plan? *****
Each participating country must develop an OGP National Action Plan (NAP)
through a multi-stakeholder, open, and participatory process. The action plan
contains concrete and measurable commitments undertaken by the participating
government to drive innovation reforms in the areas of transparency,
accountability, and citizen engagement.
The Australian consultation process was designed to be an open, transparent,
collaborative and citizen led as possible, with the support and approval of the
OGP Support Unit.
A core requirement for OGP membership is that every two years a National Action
Plan is developed publicly and transparently. The Australian Government invites
you to co-develop a vision and strategy for further progressing open government
in Australia, a strategy that outlines:
    * A vision for the future;
    * The history and status of open government in Australia;
    * Commitments to support the vision;
    * How government and the broader society can work together in achieving the
      vision; and
    * Ways to monitor and measure success.
The Australian Government’s OGP National Action Plan is expected to comply with
the Open_Government_Partnership_requirements. There is valuable guidance in the
Action Plans of other countries, such as the United_States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Indonesia. You can also review the full_list_of_OGP_countries on
the OGP site. You can read more about Australia’s engagement with OGP on the
OGP_Au_Background_page.
***** Why did Australia join the OGP? What are the benefits to Australia in
joining the OGP? *****
The goals of the Open Government Partnership align with Australia’s long and
proud tradition of open and transparent government. It also provides a
framework for the Australian Government to work directly with civil society,
the private sector and international partners to see what more can be done.
Joining the OGP is a unique opportunity for Australia to demonstrate leadership
in open government practices, to work alongside G20 counterparts in encouraging
cooperation and combating corruption, and to share knowledge on improving
public services and better managing public resources.
***** How is Australia’s performance tracked or reviewed? *****
OGP requires every participating government to engage in two forms of reporting
and assessment to promote maximum accountability of its performance in living
up to OGP commitments.  First, governments must publish an annual Self-
assessment Report after the end of each 12-month implementation cycle that
assesses government performance in making progress toward achieving its open
government commitments. Second, all OGP countries are subject to a bi-annual
assessment by the Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM). The IRM works
primarily through independent assessment reports for each OGP participating
government. Each report will assesses the development and implementation of
action plans as well as progress in fulfilling open government principles at
the country level.
***** How is progress measured? *****
The Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM) is a key means by which all
stakeholders can track OGP progress in participating countries. The IRM
produces biannual independent progress reports for each country participating
in OGP.  The progress reports assess governments on the development and
implementation of OGP action plans, progress in fulfilling open government
principles, and make technical recommendations for improvements. These reports
are intended to stimulate dialogue and promote accountability between member
governments and citizens.

***** Which Minister is responsible and taking ownership of the process? Will
they be attending and representing Australia at relevant OGP events? *****
The Prime Minister is the responsible Minister for OGP in Australia.
***** Given there’s an election in 2016, what ensures the incoming government
will not drop or change the OGP National Action Plan? *****
Once the National Action Plan is finalised, it forms part of the independent
review of progress for Australia. Any potential change in government would not
change how we are independently reviewed.
***** What funding is being attached to meeting the goals in the National
Action Plan? *****
All commitments contributed to the consultation will be considered including
the financial considerations. Funding for OGP implementation cannot be pre-
empted until the National Action Plan is finalised, and is subject to
Australian Government consideration.
***** There was a tender for creating an OGP National Action Plan which was
carried out last year. Did this form the basis of the current process? *****
The current process was developed based on best practice public engagement
strategies with input and feedback from the OGP Support Unit and other
stakeholders. The earlier tender was to develop a draft national action plan to
assist in decision making which is now not necessary to use as the agreed
consultation methodology enables a fresh start that is driven by community
contributions. We feel this is a more appropriate approach for this process
than circulating a pre-developed plan for comment.
***** Is the focus going to be on open data or on a broader open government
topics? *****
Definitely on broader open government topics, the work is not limited to open
data in any way.
***** Is the government selecting a lead civil society organisation to work
with it on the OGP National Action Plan? *****
No, at this stage we are interested in working with all civil society
organisations as well as private sector, academia, cross jurisdictional
government participants and citizens themselves.
***** How can state and local governments participate in the planning process,
and will they be bound by the Federal OGP National Action Plan? *****
This is an Australian Government National Action Plan and although States,
Territories and Local Governments are welcome to contribute, they are not bound
by this agreement.
***** The OGP is starting to allow states, as well as nations to join. Would
the Australian Government be open to an Australian State or Territory joining
the OGP in its own right? *****
Currently only national governments are eligible to formally join OGP. However,
this does not mean there is no role for sub-national governments. National
governments can pursue sub-national open government reforms that involve state
and local governments as part of their commitments. As such, sub-national
governments are encouraged to participate in national OGP efforts to explore
the possibility of including local open government reforms in the OGP National
Action Plan of the country. – See more at: http://www.opengovpartnership.org/

***** Given the initial consultation is occurring over the holiday season, how
much participation does the Australian Government actually expect from civil
societies and the community? *****
The consultation runs over 6 months which follows the OGP consultation
guidelines. Our experience is that the Christmas season provides a good
opportunity for people to think about how they want to contribute, with plenty
of time between Christmas and the consultation ending to contribute
meaningfully. People are welcome to contribute throughout the entire process.
***** How can I contribute to the consultation and developing the National
Action Plan? *****
There are key stages we need to meet to ensure consultations are completed by
the end of the June 2016 deadline. The scheduled timing for your input takes
into account the Christmas period. You can contribute online, in person at the
events, or by more traditional means, but all contributions will be added to
the online environment for peer review.
Please see the National_Action_Plan_Consultation page for full information on
the stages and how to contribute to each stage..
