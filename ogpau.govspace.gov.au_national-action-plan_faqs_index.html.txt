<span id="What_is_open_government">****What is “open government”?****</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open government means different things to different people. Many
countries around the world are working on open government initiatives,
each initiative being defined differently and tailored to the needs of
that country’s citizens and government.

For the Open Government Partnership, it is the goal that governments
will “become sustainably more transparent, more accountable and more
responsive to their own citizens, with the ultimate goal of improving
the quality of governance, as well as the quality of services that
citizens receive.”

At the heart of open government are the ideas of transparency,
participation and accountability. As a working definition;

-   Transparency means the public understands the workings of their
    government
-   Participation means public can influence the workings of government
    by engaging with public policy processes and public service
    providers
-   Accountability means the public can hold the government to account
    for its policy and service delivery performance

Citizen engagement is what open government is all about. It underpins
many of the other topics in this guide – with active citizenship often
being a vital link between transparency and accountability. The Open
Government Partnership recognises this in its eligibility criteria,
stating that: ‘Open Government requires openness to citizen
participation and engagement in policymaking and governance, including
basic protections for civil liberties’ (Open Government Partnership).

<span id="What_is_the_Open_Government_Partnership">****What is the Open Government Partnership?****</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) was launched in 2011 to provide an
international platform for domestic reformers to implement ambitious
open government reforms based on a number of commitments to make their
governments more open, accountable, responsive to citizens. Since then,
OGP has grown from 8 countries to the 69 participating countries. In all
of these countries, government and civil society are working together to
develop and implement ambitious open government reforms based on a
number of commitments to make their governments more open and
accountable. For more information visit the [Open Government
Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) website

<span id="What_do_countries_need_to_do_to_be_eligible_to_join_the_OGP_How_many_meet_these_criteria">****What do countries need to do to be eligible to join the OGP? How many meet these criteria?****</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To participate in OGP, governments must show a demonstrated commitment
to open government in four key areas – fiscal transparency, access to
information, disclosure of income and assets of elected or senior public
officials and citizen engagement. These are measured by objective
indicators and validated by independent experts.

In order to participate in OGP, countries must score at least 75% of the
total possible points available to them across the areas that are
relevant to them. Once countries have joined OGP, they are regularly
assessed to ensure they continue to abide by their commitments and their
performance measures are up to date.

Over 70 per cent of those countries which are eligible to join the OGP
have done so (based on 57 of 81 nations). Australia is considered
eligible to join and has now committed to finalising membership.

<span id="How_does_a_country_join_OGP">****How does a country join OGP?****</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three requirements to join OGP:

-   making a commitment to the OGP Declaration of Open Government, which
    aligns with existing Australian Government policy and practice (ref
    <http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration>);
-   developing a publicly consulted National Action Plan by July 2016 to
    submit to OGP with between 5-15 commitments that align to at least
    one of the five OGP “grand challenges”; and
-   undertaking an annual independent reporting of progress on the
    National Action Plan conducted by the Independent Reporting
    Mechanism of the OGP (ref <http://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm>).

<span id="Can_countries_be_expelled_from_the_OGP_once_they_become_members">****Can countries be expelled from the OGP once they become members?****</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a country’s action plan has been agreed, progress is monitored by
both other nations and civil society organisations, as well as by the
[Independent Review Mechanism
(IRM)](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm), to ensure all its
promises are met. This independent international expert group of the IRM
will inform the Steering Committee if they suspect a country as falling
below the minimum eligibility criteria. The Steering Committee can then
review the participation of said governments. In addition, governments
are also being held accountable by civil society and media in their
countries and if they perform poorly in three successive reports,
participation can be reviewed.

<span id="How_is_OGP_managed">****How is OGP managed?****</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------

OGP is overseen by a multi-stakeholder international [Steering
Committee](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/node/1325)that currently
includes nine governments and nine leading civil society
representatives. The Steering Committee serves as OGP’s key executive
management body. The Steering Committee is led by a government chair, a
supporting (or incoming) government co-chair, and two civil society
co-chairs.

More information on the OGP Steering Committee can be found
[here](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/node/1325).

<span id="How_does_Australian_intend_to_consult_with_the_public">****How does Australian intend to consult with the public?****</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Open Government Partnership](../../contact-colophon/index.html)
(OGP) requires broad consultation for the development of member
countries’ National Action Plans (NAP). This provides the public, civil
society, and the private sector with the opportunity to participate in
the process, and suggest commitments for governments to undertake.

As described in the consultation process timeline below, the Government
will use the prioritised public-suggested commitments to guide the
development of a draft NAP. Contributions for the NAP will be considered
in the context of what will improve public services and improve
management of public resources, as well as what will benefit the public,
provide opportunities for business and support innovation in Australia.

We look forward to your contributions to the consultation and public
discussions. We encourage you to contribute throughout the process and,
as this is a public consultation process, we prefer all contributions to
be made publicly for transparency and peer review.

<span id="What_is_the_criteria_for_developing_a_national_action_plan">****What is the criteria for developing a national action plan?****</span>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each participating country must develop an OGP National Action Plan
(NAP) through a multi-stakeholder, open, and participatory process. The
action plan contains concrete and measurable commitments undertaken by
the participating government to drive innovation reforms in the areas of
transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement.

The Australian consultation process was designed to be an open,
transparent, collaborative and citizen led as possible, with the support
and approval of the OGP Support Unit.

A core requirement for OGP membership is that every two years a National
Action Plan is developed publicly and transparently. The Australian
Government invites you to co-develop a vision and strategy for further
progressing open government in Australia, a strategy that outlines:

-   A vision for the future;
-   The history and status of open government in Australia;
-   Commitments to support the vision;
-   How government and the broader society can work together in
    achieving the vision; and
-   Ways to monitor and measure success.

The Australian Government’s OGP National Action Plan is expected to
comply with the [Open Government Partnership
requirements](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/requirements).
There is valuable guidance in the Action Plans of other countries, such
as the [United
States](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/united-states), [Canada](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries/canada),
the [United
Kingdom](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries/united-kingdom) and
[Indonesia](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/indonesia). You
can also review the [full list of OGP
countries](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries) on the OGP site.
You can read more about Australia’s engagement with OGP on the [OGP Au
Background page](../../background/index.html).

<span id="Why_did_Australia_join_the_OGP_What_are_the_benefits_to_Australia_in_joining_the_OGP">****Why did Australia join the OGP? What are the benefits to Australia in joining the OGP?****</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goals of the Open Government Partnership align with Australia’s long
and proud tradition of open and transparent government. It also provides
a framework for the Australian Government to work directly with civil
society, the private sector and international partners to see what more
can be done. Joining the OGP is a unique opportunity for Australia to
demonstrate leadership in open government practices, to work alongside
G20 counterparts in encouraging cooperation and combating corruption,
and to share knowledge on improving public services and better managing
public resources.

<span id="How_is_Australias_performance_tracked_or_reviewed">****How is Australia’s performance tracked or reviewed?****</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OGP requires every participating government to engage in two forms of
reporting and assessment to promote maximum accountability of its
performance in living up to OGP commitments.  First, governments must
publish an annual Self-assessment Report after the end of each 12-month
implementation cycle that assesses government performance in making
progress toward achieving its open government commitments. Second, all
OGP countries are subject to a bi-annual assessment by the Independent
Reporting Mechanism (IRM). The IRM works primarily through independent
assessment reports for each OGP participating government. Each report
will assesses the development and implementation of action plans as well
as progress in fulfilling open government principles at the country
level.

<span id="How_is_progress_measured">****How is progress measured?****</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM) is a key means by which all
stakeholders can track OGP progress in participating countries. The IRM
produces biannual independent progress reports for each country
participating in OGP.  The progress reports assess governments on the
development and implementation of OGP action plans, progress in
fulfilling open government principles, and make technical
recommendations for improvements. These reports are intended to
stimulate dialogue and promote accountability between member governments
and citizens.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Prime Minister is the responsible Minister for OGP in Australia.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the National Action Plan is finalised, it forms part of the
independent review of progress for Australia. Any potential change in
government would not change how we are independently reviewed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All commitments contributed to the consultation will be considered
including the financial considerations. Funding for OGP implementation
cannot be pre-empted until the National Action Plan is finalised, and is
subject to Australian Government consideration.

<span id="There_was_a_tender_for_creating_an_OGP_National_Action_Plan_which_was_carried_out_last_year_Did_this_form_the_basis_of_the_current_process">****There was a tender for creating an OGP National Action Plan which was carried out last year. Did this form the basis of the current process?****</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current process was developed based on best practice public
engagement strategies with input and feedback from the OGP Support Unit
and other stakeholders. The earlier tender was to develop a draft
national action plan to assist in decision making which is now not
necessary to use as the agreed consultation methodology enables a fresh
start that is driven by community contributions. We feel this is a more
appropriate approach for this process than circulating a pre-developed
plan for comment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitely on broader open government topics, the work is not limited to
open data in any way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, at this stage we are interested in working with all civil society
organisations as well as private sector, academia, cross jurisdictional
government participants and citizens themselves.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an Australian Government National Action Plan and although
States, Territories and Local Governments are welcome to contribute,
they are not bound by this agreement.

<span id="The_OGP_is_starting_to_allow_states_as_well_as_nations_to_join_Would_the_Australian_Government_be_open_to_an_Australian_State_or_Territory_joining_the_OGP_in_its_own_right">****The OGP is starting to allow states, as well as nations to join.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently only national governments are eligible to formally join OGP.
However, this does not mean there is no role for sub-national
governments. National governments can pursue sub-national open
government reforms that involve state and local governments as part of
their commitments. As such, sub-national governments are encouraged to
participate in national OGP efforts to explore the possibility of
including local open government reforms in the OGP National Action Plan
of the country. – See more at:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The consultation runs over 6 months which follows the OGP consultation
guidelines. Our experience is that the Christmas season provides a good
opportunity for people to think about how they want to contribute, with
plenty of time between Christmas and the consultation ending to
contribute meaningfully. People are welcome to contribute throughout the
entire process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are key stages we need to meet to ensure consultations are
completed by the end of the June 2016 deadline. The scheduled timing for
your input takes into account the Christmas period. You can contribute
online, in person at the events, or by more traditional means, but all
contributions will be added to the online environment for peer review.

Please see the [National Action Plan Consultation](../index.html) page
for full information on the stages and how to contribute to each stage..
