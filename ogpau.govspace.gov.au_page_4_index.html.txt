The second stage of the OGPau public consultation is about starting to
flesh out the NAP skeleton document with ideas about possible
commitments, success criteria, roles and responsibilities, mechanisms to
monitor and track progress, and how we all go about creating a cohesive
open government approach for Australia. This feedback will be collated
and will feed into a draft NAP.

We have consolidated the feedback from Stage 1 including some early
ideas for commitments into the publicly available OGPau wiki, where you
can work collaboratively with other consultation participants and the
national coordinators to develop draft content for the NAP.

How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Stage 2 – Commitments Drafting and Live Event** (14 December 2015 – 28
February 2016):

Please consider what specific actions or commitments could be included
in an Australian Government National Action Plan to support greater open
government. We also encourage you to explore the [<span
style="color: #0066cc">OGP
website</span>](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) including some of
the [<span style="color: #0066cc">actions plans from other
governments</span>](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries) and
keep in mind, this is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute
to this stage by:

-   A wiki has been set up according to the feedback from stage 1 for
    you to contribute draft commitments and other content during this
    phase and to comment on other commitments proposed. Please
    contribute at
    [https://ogpau.wikispaces.com/](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)
-   A live streamed event will be held in Canberra in February 2016 to
    air ideas, discuss and peer review approaches, and collate a body of
    input to the consultation. Please subscribe to the [<span
    style="color: #0066cc">OGP Au mailing
    list</span>](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) to indicate your interest
    in attending. All attendees will have the opportunity to present
    their idea to the group for discussion. Details about the where and
    when this forum will take place will be published on this website
    closer to the date.
-   You can add comments to this Stage 2 Blog post (below).

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian
Government National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of
information sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne and Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for
online participation and video recordings of sessions will made
available online where possible in the week following.

The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested
in understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.

The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government
Partnership, what Australia must do to fulfil its membership
requirements, and how the community can work with the Australian
Government to develop the National Action Plan collaboratively,
including how the 6 month consultation will work.

There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP
membership process and how individuals and organisations can work
constructively with the Australian Government throughout the
consultation.

The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:

**Brisbane**:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)\
Register:

Please note: the Brisbane session is being run immediately prior to an
Open Data Institute Queensland event, hence the timing and shortened
session.

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make
governments more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens.
To complete membership, the Australian Government will develop a
National Action Plan by the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP
timeline.

This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish
a vision for open government in Australia, defining the structure of the
Australian Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of
open government in Australia. The second stage of consultation will
focus on specific commitments.

How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History** (17 November 2015 – 11
December 2015):

A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision,
skeleton framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the
background/history of open government in Australia. We also encourage
you to explore the [OGP website](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
including some of the [actions plans from other
governments](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries). This is
Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:

-   Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1
    and 2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks.
    You can also indicate your interest by joining the [OGPau mailing
    list](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) and ticking the information sessions
    option, and we’ll notify you when they are open for registration.
-   Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
-   Adding feedback to the draft [Background
    page](../../background/index.html) comments.
-   Tweeting your thoughts to \#ogpau.
-   Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2
    as we need to get the framework right first.

See the [full consultation
timeline](../../national-action-plan/index.html) on the National Action
Plan Consultation page.

Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments
below for this stage. Please also find further information [About
OGP](../../about-ogp/index.html)..

We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the
contributions of others.

***Pia Waugh*** (OGPau National Action Plan Coordinator, PM&C)

Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia
--------------------------------------------------

Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the
most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world.
However, there is always more that can be done. Please contribute your
thoughts in the comments below on what a future vision for open
government could look like in Australia. We will collate the input
into the wiki at the end of this stage.

A couple of example is provided to kick things off:

-   Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
    processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
-   Open government means citizens playing a greater part in
    policy development.

Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action
Plan. The [OGP National Action Plan
template](../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_actionplan_guide%20FINAL_0.pdf)
is available le online and a useful guide though most countries deviate
from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed are identical in
structure to the template. Please add your comments on this structure
below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will be
set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.

1.  **Introduction** – an overview of the Australian Government’s
    commitment, the grand challenges addressed in the NAP (*improved
    public services* and *more effectively managing public resources*)
2.  **Vision** – the vision for open government in Australia, looking
    forward
3.  **NAP Development Process** – the process of developing the
    Australian Government National Action Plan
4.  **Open Government Efforts to Date** – background of open government
    in Australia
5.  **Overview of commitments** – an overview of the commitments, then
    broken down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to
    identify which grand challenge they support, and which principles
    they support (see [NAP page on ogpau
    website](../../national-action-plan/index.html) for detail)
6.  **Conclusion** – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be
    supported

Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.

Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia
--------------------------------------------------------------

Please add your comments to the draft [Background
page](../../background/index.html) for any additional efforts to date.
