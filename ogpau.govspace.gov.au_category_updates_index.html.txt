UPDATE 8/11/2016:
Following stakeholder feedback, the Department of the Prime Minister and
Cabinet is extending the deadline for public submissions on Australia’s first
Open Government National Action Plan to 5pm AEDT on Friday 18 November 2016.
The Government will consider changes in response to public comments before
submitting the Plan to the Open Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
We look forward to hearing your views.
===============================================================================
The Australian Government has released a draft of Australia’s first ever Open
Government National Action Plan for public consultation.
This is the final round of consultation in a year-long process to develop the
National Action Plan.
The draft Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * DOCX: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
    * HTML: Australia’s_first_Open_Government_National_Action_Plan
A fact sheet on consultation and the Plan can be accessed/downloaded here:
    * PDF: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
    * DOCX: Consultation_Fact_Sheet
The draft Plan sets out an ambitious agenda for the next two years, focused on:
    * transparency and accountability in business
    * open data and digital transformation
    * access to government information
    * integrity in the public sector
    * public participation and engagement
The creation of a National Action Plan is part of the commitment the Australian
Government made when it became a member of the Open_Government_Partnership.
Non-government stakeholders have been engaged in developing the draft Plan
through a variety of consultation activities which started in November 2015. An
Interim_Working_Group of senior public servants and non-government stakeholders
was also established in August 2016 to inform the drafting of the Plan and the
commitments.
The Open Government Partnership sets deadlines for submitting National Action
Plans. The Government will consider public comments and potential changes to
the Plan, before submitting it to the Open Government Partnership before the
end of 2016.
How_to_provide_feedback
Public submissions close at 5pm AEDT on 18 November 2016, and can be made by
emailing ogp@pmc.gov.au or by sending a hard copy to: Public Data Branch,
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, PO Box 6500, Canberra, ACT, 2600.
Please indicate when you lodge your submission if you do not wish for it to be
published online. Submissions can be accessed/downloaded here: Public
Consultation_page
The focus of this round of consultation is on the details of the proposed
commitments in the Plan (e.g. Are there potential implementation issues? Is the
level of ambition appropriate?) Consultation was undertaken earlier in 2016 to
seek ideas on potential commitments for the Plan.
Public information sessions are also being hosted jointly by government and
civil society representatives at selected locations around the country. Please
RSVP 24 hours before by emailing ogp@pmc.gov.au.

Ahead of the upcoming final stage of consultation on Australia’s first Open
Government National Action Plan, PM&C is releasing engage2’s report on the
public consultation undertaken between November 2015 and April 2016.
engage2 (a professional stakeholder engagement consultancy) was engaged by PM&C
to help design and lead a public consultation process up until April 2016. The
process is summarised in the OGPAU_Engagement_Report,  which also outlines the
outputs of the process, engage2’s lessons learned and recommendations to PM&C.
PM&C would like to thank Amelia Loye and the engage2 team for their efforts and
hard work.
The upcoming public consultation period on the full draft of the National
Action Plan is the final stage in this year-long consultation process to
develop Australia’s first Open Government National Action Plan. Stay tuned to

On Friday 7 October 2016, the Interim Working Group held a workshop at the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s offices in Sydney.
The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, the Hon. Angus
Taylor MP, attended the morning session and heard from civil society members
about their priorities for the open government agenda. Assistant Minister
Taylor noted his enthusiasm in seeing the Open Government Partnership operate
as a catalyst for action in his areas of responsibility, including the open
data agenda and digital transformation of government.
In the afternoon, members discussed the upcoming public consultation on the
draft National Action Plan. Government and civil society members agreed to work
together during this period to raise awareness about the Open Government
Partnership and seek input from a broad and diverse range of stakeholders on
the draft Plan.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has written_to_the_Open
Government_Partnership to confirm the final steps in preparing Australia’s
first National Action Plan.
The timeframe for developing the Plan has been extended to allow adequate time
for consultation within government and with the Australian public. The
timeframe also reflects the additional time and effort that has been put into
developing the Plan through the Interim Working Group of senior public servants
and civil society stakeholders.
Public consultation on the draft National Action Plan is expected to be
undertaken in late October and early November over a period of two weeks. The
Government will consider public comments before submitting the Plan to the Open
Government Partnership before the end of 2016.
Stay tuned to the blog for details about the consultation process, or sign_up

Yesterday, the Interim Working Group for Australia’s OGP National Action Plan
met for the first time. Both government and civil society members were keen to
get down to the business of co-drafting Australia’s first National Action Plan.
The group talked about the need to develop an ambitious plan and had a
productive discussion about potential commitments that could be explored.
In addition to the commitments outlined in Agenda Item 4 (see: IWG_–_Meeting_1
–_Agenda_Item_4_–_Australia’s_National_Action_Plan), civil society
representatives also nominated access to information / FOI reform and a
national integrity system as areas for further discussion.
The final minutes from the meeting will be published this week, providing an
opportunity for the public to comment on the areas of potential focus for the
plan.

Group, please email ogp@pmc.gov.au.
