Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
ogpau.wikispaces.com .

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.

To support the OGP consultation process to develop an Australian Government
National Action Plan by July 2016, we are running a series of information
sessions in the week of 14-18 December in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra. The Canberra session will be broadcast live for online participation
and video recordings of sessions will made available online where possible in
the week following.
The information sessions are for citizens and organisations interested in
understanding and potentially contributing to the process of creating
Australia’s first 2-year OGP National Action Plan.
The sessions will provide a background on the Open Government Partnership, what
Australia must do to fulfil its membership requirements, and how the community
can work with the Australian Government to develop the National Action Plan
collaboratively, including how the 6 month consultation will work.
There will be an opportunity for questions about Australia’s OGP membership
process and how individuals and organisations can work constructively with the
Australian Government throughout the consultation.
The information sessions will be held in the following cities and dates:
Brisbane:             14 December from 4:00pm – 5:15pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-brisbane-information-session.eventbrite.com
Sydney:               15 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-sydney-information-session.eventbrite.com
Canberra:            16 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time) LIVE STREAMED
Register: http://ogp-australia-information-session-canberra.eventbrite.com
To participate online please register as a remote participant for the Canberra
event
Melbourne:          17 December from 5:00 – 6:30pm (local time)
Register: http://ogp-australia-melbourne-information-session.eventbrite.com
Please note: the Brisbane session is being run immediately prior to an Open
Data Institute Queensland event, hence the timing and shortened session.
