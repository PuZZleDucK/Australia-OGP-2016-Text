<h2><span id="Australian_participation_in_the_Open_Government_Partnership">Australian participation in the Open Government Partnership</span></h2>
<p>The previous Australian Government indicated its intent to join the OGP in May 2013. In November 2015 the Australian Government launched this consultation as part of the process to finalise OGP membership.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has committed to the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration">OGP Declaration of Open Government</a> and independent reporting of Australia progress by the OGP. The Government will consult publicly to develop an Australian Government OGP National Action Plan.</p>
<p>The Australian Government can now explore other ways to participate in the various open government initiatives and working groups associated with the Open Government Partnership. Any such initiatives Australia gets involved in will be listed here.</p>

All government entities are required to produce and publicly publish their annual reports, budgets, contracts and a variety of other reporting requirements for the purposes of oversight and transparency. The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/reducingredtape/">recent independent Review of Whole-of-Government Internal Regulation</a> gives a good outline of public sector reporting in the Australian Government. From a Parliamentary perspective, Australia has also had a good track record, with a high level of transparency and reporting across all <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business">Parliamentary Business</a> including federal budgets, bills and legislation, transcripts from all Parliamentary business, tabled documents, the work of Parliamentary Committees and much more.</p>
<h3><span id="Australias_original_Declaration_of_Open_Government">Australia’s original Declaration of Open Government</span></h3>
<p>In 2009, the Gov 2.0 Taskforce was established to advise the Government on the structural barriers and enabling policies for greater information disclosure, digital innovation and online engagement. This included the division of responsibilities for, and overall coordination of, these issues within government. A <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2010/07/16/declaration-open-government/">Declaration of Open Government</a> was launched in 2010 (Archived).</p>
<p>In response, the Government made the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/strategy-and-governance/gov2/declaration-of-open-government.html" class="broken_link">Declaration of Open Government</a> and accepted in full the recommendations in the Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for Reform of Australian Government Administration report, both of which promoted greater participation in Australia’s democracy, policy and legislative reform, commitments to open government practices, and greater release of public sector information.</p>
<h3><span id="Freedom_of_Information_Privacy_Reforms">Freedom of Information &amp; Privacy Reforms</span></h3>
<p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was established in 2010 under the new Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010. Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act 1982 was updated making it easier to request information and seek review of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act).</p>
<p>The Information Publication Scheme was (IPS) which implemented directing agencies to take proactive steps to release standard government information in a consistent way reflecting the pro-disclosure goals of the FOI Act.</p>
<p>In 2014 the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) were added to Schedule 1 of the Privacy Act 1988. The APPs regulate the handling of personal information by Australian government and some private sector organisations.</p>
<h3><span id="Platforms_for_Data_Release">Platforms for Data Release</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://data.gov.au/">Data.gov.au</a> was established in 2010 to enable the centralisation and distribution of open data and access to government data APIs. The website was allocated resourcing to initiate whole of government direction and curation of data. In 2012, data.gov.au was allocated resources to strengthen its role as an essential element in Australia’s open government strategy. The number of datasets available on the website has grown from 500 to over 7,000, and is now working in alignment with state and territory and local governments via the Cross Jurisdictional Open Data Working Group to improve open data offerings nationwide.</p>
<h3><span id="Adoption_of_Creative_Commons">Adoption of Creative Commons</span></h3>
<p>In order to accommodate greater access to government information and bring consistency in licensing arrangements, the public service adapted Creative Commons Attribution 3.0. The adaption of the license enabled all government content with the exception of Commonwealth Coat of Arms and unless specifically stated elsewhere. Details in the <a href="../../../www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IntellectualProperty/Documents/StatementofIPprinciplesforAusGovagencies.html" class="broken_link">AGD Statement of Intellectual Property Principles for Australian Government</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="National_Commission_of_Audit">National Commission of Audit</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ncoa.gov.au/">National Commission of Audit’s</a> (2014) focus on improving the management of public resources has enabled progressive whole of government changes in a short time. The government has been proactive in addressing the recommendations within the 2014/15 budget and in immediate organisational changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource management.</p>
<p>As part of the structural reforms following the Audit, we have seen amalgamations of key government functions including the creation of the Data Policy Branch within the Department of Communications. This branch is now positioned to provide overall data policy direction on whole of government initiatives including the development and implementation of the Australian Government Open Data policy.</p>
<p>The Audit also recommended further centralisation, sharing, and reuse of government resources with a focus on gaining from the opportunities innovation in technology can provide.</p>
<h3><span id="Changes_in_culture">Changes in culture</span></h3>
<p>Open government practices and advances have a dramatic impact on the federal and state and territory public services. The Australian Public Service is learning to value the contribution which more transparent, interactive, and open government practices can offer. It is benefiting from being a workforce which is looking for improvements based on our public needs – not just to solve problems when they arise, it is engaging with the public partnerships to actively encourage private enterprise to provide public services, and it is leveraging the skills and knowledge of the public to improve how it manages its services, manages its data, implements new processes. These changes in culture have been supported by a number of reports in recent years:</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in government through its legislated role of setting records and information management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and preserving and providing a public right of access to government information. The National Archives supports the consideration of open government efforts to date in development of the National Action Plan, and inclusion of a section covering this in the Plan itself. </p>
<p>Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), the National Archives:<br />
•	identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;<br />
•	preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth accessible;<br />
•	oversees Commonwealth records management;<br />
•	determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and<br />
•	imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.</p>
<p>The Archives Act ensures that evidence of the most important decisions and actions of the Australian Government are identified and preserved , and provides a right of access to this information. The National Archives submits that its role in providing the foundations for successful open government be recognised in the National Action Plan.</p>
<p>The current background includes a section on Freedom of Information and Privacy reforms. The 2010 reforms also resulted in amendments to the Archives Act. The primary change was a reduction in the open access period (after which members of the public have a right of access to Australian government records) from 30 years to 20 years, phased in over a 10-year period to 2021. The Archives recommends that this change be included in the proposed section on Freedom of Information and Privacy reforms.</p>
<p>In addition, the Archives recommends that a section be included on archival access to detail the right of access provided by both Commonwealth and state archival legislation to government records. In addition to the Commonwealth Archives Act, since the 1920s  state archival legislation has established a right of access to government records. This long history of access to government records afforded by the various archival authorities should be recognised in the background on open government efforts to date.</p>
<p>History of the National Archives<br />
For almost one hundred years, the National Archives has supported the principles of open government access through provisions for the regulation of the creation, management and destruction of records, and promotion of access to Australian government records.</p>
<p>The need for a Commonwealth archival role was first recognised by Prime Minister Hughes in the 1920s, with the increasing volume of records and the effect or World War I creating an awareness of the historical value of some Commonwealth records. As a result, the Commonwealth National Library was tasked with regulating the destruction of records by Commonwealth agencies, to ensure that records that could prove valuable to future governments and historians were not destroyed. This sews the first seeds of open government, by ensuring that significant records were retained for future access by Australian citizens.</p>
<p>The first body with formal responsibility for archives was the War Archives Committee which was created in the 1940s. With the initial aim of safeguarding the history of both world wars, this role grew with the end of World War II to oversight of the disposal of all past and future records and coordination of the archival work of the War Memorial and the Commonwealth National Library which had been designated as custodians of government records. Taking control of destruction was one of the main problems of the postwar years as temporary agencies wound up, as well as the need to save the money through the efficient disposal of records.</p>
<p>There was at this stage no formal provision for public access to records. In 1966 however the Cabinet agreed to a general policy on access, introducing a 50-year rule, with World War I records available earlier. In 1970, in alignment with public access provisions in Britain, the Australian government adopted the 30-year rule, making records generally available for public access after they had been in existence for 30 years. These provisions for public access to records are the first steps in open government.</p>
<p>There was however still no archival legislation. An early attempt by the Parliamentary Library Committee in 1927 to pass an Archives Bill through Parliament had failed. In June 1978, a draft Archives Bill was introduced in the Senate as part of a package of administrative law measures with the Administrative Appeals and Freedom of Information Bills. The Archives Act was passed later than the other two Acts (1975 and 1982) in 1983 due largely to concerns with provisions for exemption from access. The Archives Act complements the right of access afforded by the Freedom of Information Act 1982, while also providing for the restriction from access of material of continuing sensitivity.</p>
<p>The functions of the National Archives which are enshrined in the Archives Act– disposal of non-current records, custody of records of ongoing value and a right of access to these records &#8211; underpin the principles of open government and should be recognised in any overview of open government efforts to date.</p>
<p>National Archives current initiatives<br />
The archival resources of the Commonwealth are a unique source of evidence and information about the nature of the Commonwealth Government and its activities. Identifying, preserving and making accessible the archival resources of Commonwealth is not only essential for the conduct of Australian government but also:<br />
•	assists the Government and the public to scrutinise the decisions and activities of Commonwealth institutions;<br />
•	allows the community to retain and transfer knowledge, learn from past experience, and protect the interests of Australians collectively and individually; and<br />
•	helps satisfy people’s interest in the decisions and actions of Government that affected their and previous generations’ lives or shaped the development of Australia.</p>
<p>The records that document and provide evidence of decisions and actions of the Australian Government provide a strong foundation for transparency and accountability. Australian Government records also hold information that is essential for policy development and the delivery of services.</p>
<p>The National Archives’ more recent work in implementing the Digital Continuity 2020 policy and the Digital Transition Policy provides a valuable platform to assist Australian Commonwealth agencies to embed a culture of openness and transparency across government. When records are digital and managed well, agencies reduce duplication of effort, save time, save money and most importantly can share knowledge and information within and across agencies, as well as with the Australian community.</p>
<p>Examples of the current efforts that the Archives will be contributing to the National Action Plan as part of its development will include:</p>
<p>Digital and Online Access<br />
The National Archives holds over 362.8 shelf kilometres of paper and other analogue records and 462.5 terabytes of digital records in secure, environmentally controlled repositories around the country. In addition to providing access to our collection through our network of reading rooms, access is provided online via the Archives website and the collection database RecordSearch, as well as a number of specialised websites including Discovering Anzacs (defence service), Destination Australia (immigration) and Vrroom (for schools).</p>
<p>The National Archives is also progressively digitising the collection to make items more accessible. As at the end of September 2015 over 41 million pages had been digitised, with more being added each week. In 2014-15, over 13 million records were accessed via the Archives website. We regularly consult with the public to identify items of the greatest significance to the Australian community and to make them available online. </p>
<p>Digital Continuity 2020 Policy<br />
The Digital Continuity 2020 Policy centres on digital information governance and complements the Australian Government&#8217;s digital transformation agenda and the digital economy. The policy aims to support efficiency, innovation, interoperability, transparency, information re-use and accountability by integrating robust digital information management into all government business processes.</p>
<p>The policy is based on three principles, with targets that agencies should reach by 2020, as well as a pathway identifying interim targets. All Digital Continuity 2020 targets are expected to be achieved as part of normal business reviews and ongoing technology maintenance and investment cycles.</p>
<p>End to end digital project<br />
An ICT solution that develops capabilities to manage digital government information (born digital and digitised) to:<br />
•	provide appropriate online access to all records as soon as possible to the public utilising available communication technology, at the time the records are required, and in a format and on platforms that meet their requirements;<br />
•	incorporate mandated metadata enabling interoperability and sharing of information across Australian Government portals, and where appropriate, government business systems;<br />
•	ingest, preserve and manage the Commonwealth’s digital records in the cloud ensuring their long term integrity, authenticity, and accuracy; and<br />
•	provide cost effective and efficient sentencing of Commonwealth agency digital records and their transfer to the Archives.</p>
<p>Legislative Reform<br />
The Archives Act provides a public right of access to Commonwealth records in the open access period.  The Act was amended in 2011 to reduce the open access period from 30 years to 20 for Commonwealth records, and for Cabinet notebooks from 50 years to 30, with the reduction being phased in over a 10-year period. </p>
<p>The National Archives jointly with the Attorney-General’s Department is currently developing a broad package of legislative amendments that will amongst other things, seek to address digital transformation related matters and improve equitable access to the Archives’ collection for all Australians.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The Role of Information Commissioners in Open Government<br />
The role of Information Commissioners across Australia is to encourage public sector agencies to champion open government and to promote the release of information to stakeholders and the community.  All government activity originates in and is sustained by information. Increasing access to government information is fundamental to open, democratic government engagement with citizens and accountability. State and Territory Information Commissioners play a central role in facilitating improved information management and release to bolster transparency.</p>
<p>The following information relates to New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.</p>
<p>Information access laws across Australian jurisdictions<br />
Information access and Freedom of Information (FOI) laws across Australian jurisdictions are supportive of open government. The objects of each legislative regime demonstrate a commitment to open access of government-held information, transparency and accountability based on democratic principles, including to encourage community participation in decision-making. The information access regimes have, over the past few years, moved towards supporting and encouraging the proactive disclosure of information by public sector agencies to citizens and the community.</p>
<p>•	Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA Act): the GIPA Act commenced operation on 24 September 2010. In the second reading speech about the GIPA Bill, the then Premier Mr Nathan Rees stated that members of the public should be able to have access to the widest possible range of information to give them confidence in Government decision-making. He also stated that the GIPA Bill shifted the focus toward proactive disclosure.<br />
The GIPA Act is founded on a commitment to maintain and advance a system of responsible and representative democratic Government that is open, accountable, fair and effective. The object of this Act is to open government information to the public by (a) authorising and encouraging the proactive public release of government information by agencies, and (b) giving members of the public an enforceable right to access government information, and (c) providing that access to government information is restricted only when there is an overriding public interest against disclosure. The GIPA Act promotes the proactive disclosure of information through four information release and access pathways – mandatory proactive release of information; authorised proactive release; informal access; formal access. </p>
<p>•	Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Victoria) (FOI Act): The FOI Act commenced on 5 July 1983 and 5 July 1984. The object of this Act is to extend as far as possible the right of the community to access information in the possession of the Government of Victoria and other bodies constituted under the law of Victoria for certain public purposes by (a) making available to the public information about the operations of agencies and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with agencies are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices; and (b) creating a general right of access to information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers and agencies limited only by exceptions and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by agencies. Part II of the Act requires Ministers and agencies to annually publish a range of documents including policies and procedures affecting the public, categories of documents held, certain reports, as well as information about how members of the public may inspect and purchase documents.</p>
<p>•	Right to Information Act 2009 (Queensland) (RTI Act): The RTI Act commenced on 1 July 2009. The primary object of the RTI Act is to give a right of access to information in the government’s possession or under the government’s control unless, on balance, it is contrary to the public interest to give the access. Information may be accessed other than by a formal application under this Act, for example, the Act requires that significant and appropriate information held by agencies be made publicly available through publication schemes, preferably online. The RTI Act aims to make more information available, provide equal access to information across all sectors of the community, and provide appropriate protection for individuals&#8217; privacy. Under the RTI Act, information is released administratively as a matter of course, unless there is a good reason not to, with formal access applications being used as a last resort.</p>
<p>•	Freedom of Information Act 1991 (South Australia) (FOI Act): the FOI Act commenced operation on 1 January 1992. The FOI Act gives every member of the public a right to:<br />
o	access documents which are held by state government departments, statutory authorities, councils, public hospitals and universities, subject to certain exceptions in the Act; and<br />
o	have records which concern their personal affairs amended, if those records are incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.<br />
In his explanatory speech on the Bill, the then Attorney-General, the Hon Chris Sumner MLC, talked of the three major premises on which the Bill was based: (1) the individual has a right to know what information is contained in Government records about him or herself; (2) a Government that is open to public scrutiny is more accountable to the people who select it; (3) where people are informed about Government policies, they are more likely to become involved in policy making and in Government itself. The objects of the Act are to promote openness in government and accountability of Ministers of the Crown and other government agencies and thereby to enhance respect for the law and further the good government of the State; and to facilitate more effective participation by members of the public in the processes involved in the making and administration of laws and policies.</p>
<p>NSW, Victoria and Queensland have Information Commissioners who are independent statutory office holders.</p>
<p>•	NSW: The Information Commissioner oversights the operation of the GIPA Act. The Information Commissioner’s functions include to promote agencies’ understanding and practical application of the Act; measure, monitor and report on agency compliance; report on the operation of the GIPA Act to Parliament; and review decisions of agencies on request under the GIPA Act. </p>
<p>•	Victoria: the FOI Commissioner’s functions and powers include to promote understanding and acceptance by agencies of the Act and its object; to conduct reviews of decisions by agencies on requests under the Act; to receive and handle complaints; to monitor compliance by agencies with those professional standards; to provide advice, education and guidance to agencies in relation to compliance with any professional standards; to provide advice, education and guidance to agencies and the public; to report on the operation of the Act; to provide advice to the Minister on the operation and administration of the Act. In carrying out these functions the office the FOI Commissioner aims to ensure there is a fair and transparent flow of government held information, and to educate Victorians and the agencies that work on their behalf to understand their rights and responsibilities to one another.</p>
<p>•	Queensland: the Office of the Information Commissioner’s role includes independently review decisions made by Queensland Ministers and public sector agencies about access to or amendment of, documents; to mediate privacy complaints; promote information rights and responsibilities; and foster improvements in the quality of right to information privacy practices.<br />
The Information Commissioner is supported by two other statutory office holders appointed by the Governor-in-Council – the Right to Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner.</p>
<p>South Australia does not have Information Commissioners and instead, relies on the Ombudsman to provide a complaint or review function, and to champion open and transparent government. State Records assists the Minister responsible for administrating the FOI Act. The Ombudsman is the review authority under the FOI Act for external reviews of agencies’ decisions under the FOI Act (including in relation to access, amendment of personal records, and fees and charges).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This response has been provided by Information Commissioners and does not reflect the views of the respective State and Territory governments.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Regarding background &#8211; in the culture section I think it is worth noting that:<br />
a) Groups of public servants, interested citizens and professionals working to advance the practice of Open Gov and Gov2 in Australia have formed to constructively support the development of Open Govt across Australia. Many of these events have occurred after hours and on weekends with attendees doing so out of interest, in their own time.<br />
b) There have been a significant number of Hackathons, GovCamps (and BarCamps) to advance the practice of Open Gov and encourage the use of Open Data in Australia.<br />
c) The Australia Government have hosted and sponsored a number of these events to engage citizens and business. In addition to these events they (you) have also hosted events to share Open Gov methods and tools with others across Government &#8211; which have been open to public participation.<br />
d) Even when these events were not &#8216;hosted&#8217; or sponsored by Govt, they have been fairly well attended by public servants either as interested citizens and sometimes endorsed by their managers and on Gov / employer time.<br />
e) In addition to these events, Pia, as an APS staffer, and several others in her team have been accessible to, and promoted the initiatives of, others advancing Open Gov both inside and from outside of Government (at all levels) across Australia (and with other Countries).<br />
This above has helped maintained the momentum, interest and practice of Open Gov in Australia even though we have not formally had another Open Gov partnership &#8211; nationally or internationally.<br />
In saying all the above &#8211; I, and I can confidently say many of the others I have come across though my work in this field, do not underestimate what commitment to the OGP means and will be very pleased to see a National Action Plan.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Perhaps understandably the material in the section Australian participation in the Open Government Partnership is an abbreviated positive version of the interrupted journey towards finalising membership of the OGP. </p>
<p>The omissions in the section on Freedom of Information and Privacy Reforms, some of which are mentioned by James McKay however really distort the true picture.</p>
<p> If the bill to abolish the OAIC is withdrawn and the FOI and information policy functions of the office adequately funded, fewer corrections would be needed. </p>
<p>We can get by perhaps without a reference in this section or under Culture to Public Service Commissioner Lloyd&#8217;s opinion that FOI is &#8216;very pernicious.&#8217; To then Australian Information Commissioner McMillan&#8217;s view that some agencies are &#8216;gaming the system.&#8217; Or to Treasury Secretary Fraser&#8217;s observation that public servants these days don&#8217;t write sensitive stuff down.</p>
<p>But if the National Commission on Audit is mentioned on the plus side, people like me remember the Australian Law Reform Commission Report Secrecy and Open Government never received a government response. That the Australian Information Commissioner made recommendations in a report that quickly disappeared about improvements to the review process. And that the privacy changes mentioned in the draft were Phase1 changes reflecting issues raised in the mammoth ALRC Privacy Report of 2007. Phases Two and Three of the government response never appeared again, although generously we could add that mandatory breach notification has just been delayed. Two of those lost causes were that the Commonwealth lead on national consistency regarding privacy protection, and a recommendation that Australia legislate a cause of action for a serious breach of privacy.</p>
<p>The Platforms for Data Release Section is incomplete without reference to the findings in the report by your own department last week that weren&#8217;t uniformly positive.</p>
<p>The Changes in Culture Section is the equal of the Australian participation in the Open Government Partnership Section in telling part of the story.</p>
<p>Overall without listing all the warts the Background Section should be honest and realistic about where things stand. At the moment it reads like one of those rarely read annual reports that are brimming with good news and admit no failures or concerns.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Perhaps it is worth explaining why many core datasets have been unable to be released. Some of these are cultural but others are structural.</p>
<p>Government organisations such as the PSMA, Australia Post and the Bureau of Meteorology hold many core reference datasets that have not been released as open data e.g. Weather forecasts, postcodes, addresses, and more.</p>
<p>The business models and funding arrangements for these organisations work against them publishing open data as the PSMA explain here <a href="https://www.psma.com.au/publications/news/delivering-benefits-through-open-data" rel="nofollow">https://www.psma.com.au/publications/news/delivering-benefits-through-open-data</a></p>
<p>The closed nature of these datasets holds back Australia&#8217;s standing globally (e.g. <a href="http://index.okfn.org/" rel="nofollow">http://index.okfn.org</a>) but more importantly, inhibits the generation of value in a number of areas. The release of weather data is important to support both agriculture and disaster management. Addresses and Postcodes would be used by nearly every business in Australia. I can&#8217;t believe we can&#8217;t even publish State Boundaries as open data (<a href="http://data.gov.au/dataset/other-state-boundary-psma-administrative-boundaries" rel="nofollow">http://data.gov.au/dataset/other-state-boundary-psma-administrative-boundaries</a>) with the licence for personal use expiring on 30 Dec 2015.</p>
<p>Perhaps there have been efforts to release this data &#8211; if so, they should be acknowledged. If not, then we have a nice segway into some future actions.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It is wonderful to see Australia embracing this process at last after sitting on its hands and going in the opposite direction for so long. </p>
<p>We note and endorse all of Steve Davies comments in his post on November 23rd at 10:47 am. </p>
<p>Australia is suffering from 20th century policies that have resulted in a “hollowing out” of communities and also of civil society.  This has meant a reduction in community participation and control of services and decision-making within communities.  This has resulted in a loss of knowledge, skills, involvement, interest, and even more importantly, in the confidence needed to participate effectively.  Our communities have disengaged from key issues affecting them, their communities and the country.  </p>
<p>This is no more apparent and more counterproductive than in services to the community provided by or funded by government.  Many, like the jobs market and vocational training, have failed.   Major community stakeholders and the community itself have been excluded from participation in planning as well as from implementation largely because they would have held contrary views and challenged implementation.  This is well illustrated in aged care where even the Productivity Commission has commented on the adverse impact poor public awareness has had on the implementation of changes – changes where many would have advocated community involvement, better alternatives and better implementation.</p>
<p>Open government cannot be effective and recognise its potential unless there is a knowledgeable, skilled and interested civic community of citizens willing to engage and participate.   We have allowed our civic society to decay.  Open government is primarily about engaging with civil society, which is where Australia is most deficient.  It has instead focused on stakeholders who represent particular commercial, employee and other marketplace interests, so distorting the input that it gets.</p>
<p>The most important grand challenge for Australia, if it is going to assume a leadership role in this endeavour and recover the ground it has lost, is to re-engage the community in the affairs of the community at all levels.  I am writing to urge Australia to put “Participation” as its first “grand challenge” ahead of the two planned. “Improving Public Services” should be second as it is largely responsible for what has happened. Together they will set the scene for further developments.  There is growing evidence showing the importance of community involvement in services to their communities – both to the success of the services and to building social capital and so rejuvenating civil society.</p>
<p>The team behind Aged Care Crisis Inc. is addressing these problems and trying to bring aged care into the 21st century by opening discussion within the community and by making submissions to government inquiries.  We are urging changes that would see community groups involved in the provision, in the management, in the control of, and in decision making at all levels of the aged care process.  We want to see the development of a community with the knowledge and skills needed in the community, skills that are also required for effective open government.  We urge government and those communities receiving other government services to adopt a similar approach.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Observations around the text of FOI Reforms &#8211; the following statement is true:</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the course of the next four years the Freedom of Information Act 1982 was updated making it easier to request information and seek review of FOI decisions. Parliament enacted reforms with the passage of the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 (Cth) and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act).&#8221;</p>
<p>What is not mentioned is the current Government policy contained within the Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill 2014 to actually roll back some of those reforms. </p>
<p>In fact, since then, things have become harder, due to the miserly funding cuts doled out to the OAIC, frustrating their statutory obligations to promote the purposes of the FOI Act across the APS (although I must commend the OAIC for carrying on so determinedly with such few resources).</p>
<p>Nor is there the acknowledgement that in 2013, a review in to FOI law and administration was carried out by Dr Hawke, with the number one recommendation being &#8220;that a comprehensive review of the FOI Act be undertaken&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was no recommendation in that review to abolish the OAIC, which is part of the current bill before Parliament.</p>
<p>If the &#8220;Background&#8221; to the actual status of Open Government in Parliament is muddied and presents a selective recent history, then the very principles of transparency are being undermined at the first turn.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Time and again the issue of the culture of the Australian Public Service has been identified as being highly problematic for open government and, indeed, innovation.</p>
<p>Through my work and many conversations what stands out is that there is considerable cultural resistance to engaging in open dialogue about the more extreme manifestations of the cultural short comings of the Australian Public Service.</p>
<p>Four aspects of the culture stand out. They are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Practices that generate large amounts of self-censorship.</p>
<p>2. There is a lot of fear about having difficult and confronting conversations. So one of key challenges is to strip away that fear. To ensure, from the very first step, that all people &#8211; not just those who are &#8216;into open government&#8217; &#8211; know (at its most elemental level), that it&#8217;s OK to speak out.</p>
<p>3. The distorting impact of the obsession with the reputation of the public service being so severe that it generates destructive and self serving defensive routines. At its worse this results in systemic abuses of power (and there are many).</p>
<p>4. The very low tolerance of challenging and dissenting views and information.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but suffice it so say these cultural artefacts (and more) are anathema to open government. Consequently, it is imperative (if there is to be any depth to open government), that these issues be publicly discussed.</p>
<p>Doing so is essential to demonstrating to the public that the Australian Government is authentic about open government and encouraging engagement.</p>
<p>If we fall into the trap (again), of not having these difficult conversations about the health of government and public service then we will be providing and weak platform for open government and Australian democracy in the 21st century. Let alone decency in government.</p>
<p>By showing courage and being forthright about these issues I believe Australia could set a world leading example in relation to the Open Government Partnership.</p>
<p>Cheers &#8211; Steve</p>
<p>ps. I you wish to discuss these views personally contact me on <a href="mailto:steve8davies@gmail.com">steve8davies@gmail.com</a> in the first instance.</p>
