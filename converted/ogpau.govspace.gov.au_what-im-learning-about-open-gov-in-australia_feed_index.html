		<description><![CDATA[The list appears comprehensive-ish, and forgive me if I have missed the mark when it comes to accessing government records, information and data.

All jurisdictions will have an Records/Archives authority. Each of which provides access to records that are in jurisdictions open access period. Open access periods vary in each state and territory - but it still it is an opportunity and function that has been over-looked in this list.

Federal/Commonwealth:
National Archives of Australia - (and reading through the site, I have seen that they have provided some comment on some parts)
Under the Archives Act 1983, the National Archives has two main roles:
- to preserve Australia’s most valuable government records and encourage their use by the public; and
- to promote good records management by Australian Government agencies.
In fulfilling these responsibilities, we ensure that Australians have access to a national archival collection so they may better understand their heritage and democracy (taken directly from their website - about us)

They have a  records search function and also areading room which provides appropriate access to commonewealth held records to australian community.
