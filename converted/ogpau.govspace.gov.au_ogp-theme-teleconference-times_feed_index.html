		<description><![CDATA[Hi Henare. Thanks for posting the links Henare. I invited everyone who had suggested an action under a theme to attend and posted the link to register on the wiki pages for each theme. These events are being held to encourage and complement three way engagement on the wiki. I am also adding summaries of discussions on each theme pages of the wiki to boost three way engagement. The intent is to be as available as I can to those of you suggesting actions before submissions close Thursday. My team scheduled the Ongoing Engagement session as our first event, but I thought it should be last based on theme based discussions so needed to modify in eventbrite before posting the link. Those who have suggested actions under this theme received an email invitation on Thursday. I&#039;ve been unwell this weekend and in teleconferences most of today so forgot to post it on the theme - thanks for the reminder. Amelia]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.

Gosh. There&#039;s late notice and then there&#039;s late notice :-(

I appreciate getting an email invite (since I didn&#039;t hear about this any other way) but the email was sent after close of business on a 4 day long Easter weekend for a call happening the day everyone&#039;s back from holidays (not to mention 2 days out from the deadline).

I&#039;m very disappointed to be unable to participate due to this lack of notice.

&#062;I have also posted links under each themes in the wiki so you can register for events and access the teleconference details.

Why not link them here so they&#039;re accessible:

Tuesday the 29th March:

* 13:00 ‚Äì 14:00 Fiscal Transparency - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/invitation-to-ogpau-national-action-plan-fiscal-transparency-workshop-tickets-23964131362
* 14:30 ‚Äì 15:30 Fostering innovation - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-government-integrity-workshop-tickets-23964773282
* 15:30 ‚Äì 16:30 Freedom of Information - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-freedom-of-information-workshop-tickets-23964446304
* 16:30 ‚Äì 17:30 Government Integrity - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-fostering-innovation-workshop-tickets-23964357037

Wednesday the 30th March:

* 12:00 ‚Äì 13:00 Open Data - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-open-data-workshop-tickets-23964922729
* 13:00 ‚Äì 14:00 Public Service Delivery - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-public-service-delivery-workshop-tickets-23965031053
* 14:30 ‚Äì 15:30 Resource Management - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-resource-management-workshop-tickets-23965156428
* 15:30 ‚Äì 16:30 Public Participation - https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ogpau-national-action-plan-public-participation-workshop-tickets-23965277791
* 17:00 ‚Äì 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU - &quot;If you have not received an invitation and you would like to attend please get in touch.&quot;

Is the final teleconference intentionally invite only? I might try to make that since it&#039;s the one with the most lead time.]]></description>
