		<p>The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.</p>
<p>This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in Australia.

<h2><span id="Building_a_Vision_for_Open_Government_in_Australia">Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia</span></h2>
<p>Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.</p>
<p>A couple of example is provided to kick things off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.</li>
<li>Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy development.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in government through its legislated role of setting records and information management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and preserving and providing a public right of access to government information.</p>
<p>Open government increases the transparency and accountability of government, encourages greater public engagement, strengthens governance and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key role in open government by promoting the creation, management and preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information, and facilitating access to this information.</p>
<p>The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and effectively covers all information created, used or received in the course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) (Archives Act), the National Archives:<br />
•	identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;<br />
•	preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth accessible;<br />
•	oversees Commonwealth records management;<br />
•	determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and<br />
•	imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.</p>
<p>Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government policy. It is from this perspective and with this legislated role that the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on the Vision and the framework for the National Action Plan.</p>
<p>Vision<br />
The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved management of, and accessibility to, information and records. A key element of this is a move to fully digital information management and business processes across the Australian government sector. This aligns with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading including earlier access to government records, the Digital Continuity 2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.</p>
<p>The National Archives also recommends that the Vision and Plan recognise Australia’s strong open government history, culture, initiatives and policies already in existence, including the Archives Act, to demonstrate Australia as a leading example of open government well before the Open Government Partnership came into being.</p>
<p>The government also recognises through legislation such as the Archives Act 1983, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 the need to restrict the circulation of some information for a particular time in order to protect the defence and security of the nation, its relationship with the world, and the privacy of citizens. The Archives Act entrusts the National Archives with this role in relation to government information and provides for the exemption from public release of a number of categories of information including national security, defence, international relations, confidential information, and personal affairs. When sensitivities lapse, information that was formerly withheld can be made available for access. The balance between the need to protect information from unauthorised use or accidental release, and open government principles should be considered in development of the Vision.</p>
<p>The Australian Government’s policy of open government is well established, and it is therefore well positioned to contribute to the Open Government Partnership and the National Action Plan. It will also be well positioned to target areas that require more effort to continue to advance open government in Australia. The National Archives has, and will continue to, play a key role in supporting open government initiatives by carrying out its core functions and by effectively contributing to Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership.</p>
<p>Framework<br />
The National Archives supports the general framework outlined in the Australian Government National Action Plan template, and recommends a clear and strong statement of Open Government achievements to date from both a contemporary and historical context. We would particularly like to note Australia as one of the most open archival and government information access regimes in the world through the management, preservation and provision of access to government information under the Archives Act.</p>
<p>Established by the Act, one of the National Archives’ key roles is enabling public access to the archival resources of the nation. Through this role, the Archives has played a lead in open government and ensuring that citizens have access to the decisions and actions of their government, thereby supporting the rights and entitlements of individuals and promoting accountability and transparency.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This is  increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the design, delivery and evaluation of  those programs.<br />
However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by this approach to &#8216;engagement&#8217;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>[Pia Waugh] The following comment was contributed via email from Tim Smith of the Accountability Round Table and is published here with permission, along with a link to the longer submission sent.</p>
<p>[Tim Smith] I Chair the Accountability Round Table (<a href="http://www.accountabilityrt.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.accountabilityrt.org/</a>).   Its aims and objectives mirror those of the Open Government Partnership. It came into existence in 2006 and, since then, has been seeking to achieve those aims and objectives at the Commonwealth and State levels.</p>
<p>The Government should be congratulated in recently confirming its commitment to the OGP and embarking upon the preparation of the National Action Plan.  The Australian community has been provided with a unique and very significant opportunity to reform our Commonwealth Parliamentary democracy, and indirectly those of the States and Territories, by addressing, in partnership with the Government, the serious weaknesses and problems that have developed in our that Democracy. It has the potential to be the most important development in Australia’s Democracies since Federation. Whether that is realised will depend, in large measure, on the Australian Community’s response within this new Partnership.</p>
<p>ART has made a submission to the Government addressing the matters raised in this first stage (Link to submission).  In it, ART submits that it will be critical for the successful formulation of Australia’s NAP, that the Partnership, from the outset address the following. </p>
<p>1.	Identify what should guide this Partnership enterprise. This includes &#8211;<br />
•	the Objectives of the OGP and its Mission Statement,<br />
•	the nature and purposes of parliamentary democracies and<br />
•	a fundamental but long forgotten ethical and common-law principle &#8211; that public office is a public trust and that those holding public office are under a fiduciary obligation when exercising their powers entrusted to them to place the public interest first and ahead of their own interests and other private interests. </p>
<p>ART submits that all people who participate in this Partnership enterprise, should be guided by these matters and principles. </p>
<p>We also submit that the absence of the public office public trust principle from our Australian consciousness for many years has been a major factor in the problems that now exist in our Commonwealth Democracy; </p>
<p>2.	Accurately and completely establish not only the past history of our Commonwealth democracy but also its current reality, good and bad.  We submit that significantly more work is needed to complete this task &#8212; in respect of both the good and the bad.</p>
<p>Applying the above objectives and principles to the actual realities, past and present, the Partnership can proceed with reasonable confidence in choosing, in the public interest, the<br />
•	OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that should be selected and<br />
•	the commitments that should be given priority in the NAP.</p>
<p>The Partnership can also articulate its Vision and fine tune the proposed Framework for the development of the NAP.</p>
<p>The Submission discusses these issues, the relevant evidence and the choices of the OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that will best serve the public interest in the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
<p>We hope that it will be found helpful in each stage of this historic exercise.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>TIA congratulates the Australian Government and Prime Minister Turnbull for the recent decision to commit to finalizing Australia’s membership of the OGP, and for the proactive approach it is taking to public consultation in the development of the first Australian Government National Action Plan.</p>
<p>The OGP requires broad consultation in the development of the NAP – from the public, civil society and the private sector.  TIA’s comments come from its perspective as the leading civil society organization promoting transparency, integrity and accountability, and fighting corruption.  </p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Now that it has decided to commit to finalizing its membership of the OGP, the government is moving with commendable speed to draft its first National Action Plan by May 2016, for government consideration in June 2016, and a launch in July 2016.  This speed does bring risks – that the first National Action Plan is essentially a ‘goodwill’ document, not ambitious enough and not containing commitments of substance.  The second risk is that to meet these tight timelines the consultation process will be structured in a way which downplays the opportunity for real input from civil society and other non-government sectors.  The Government and its advisers may take the view that it is better to have a first NAP, however imperfect, and that the NAP process and content will be much more satisfactory the second time around.  TIA’s job, and that of civil society generally, is to participate as fully as possible in the development of a first NAP which is ambitious in scope and commitment, and flags priority areas for future NAPs. TIA is committed to membership of the Australian Open Government Partnership Network recently constituted</p>
<p>The remainder of this short paper flags some initial comments and areas of interest to TIA.</p>
<p>Increasing Public Integrity</p>
<p>The OGP – Australia website has already indicated that the first National Action Plan will focus on two of the OGP’s five ‘grand challenges’: Improving Public Services, and More Effectively Managing Public Resources.  This decision was made without public consultation on whether other ‘grand challenges’ should have greater priority, especially Increasing Public Integrity (‘measures that address corruption and public ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom’).  Successive Australian Governments have made considerable and sustained progress in improving public services and more effectively managing public resources, whereas limited and patchy progress has been made in the areas of corruption and public ethics, access to information, and campaign finance reform.  In other words, there is much more to do in relation to increasing public integrity.  TIA recommends that the Government include Increasing Public Integrity as one of its initial ‘grand challenges’.</p>
<p>Identification of specific measures in the Australian NAP</p>
<p>Many of the potential transparency gains from the OGP are cross-cutting issues that affect integrity in other sectors, other nations and multiple levels of government.  In several countries, including the UK, ‘open government’ has been used to identify and implement crucial transparency and accountability measures such as the establishment of registers of beneficial ownership of companies, lifting the veil on opaque shell companies that the corrupt use to hold and transfer their illicit gains, implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative or developing comprehensive national anti-corruption agencies or comprehensive national anti-corruption action plans.</p>
<p>TIA recommends that the Australian Government demonstrate its full commitment to participation in the Open Government Partnership, by undertaking to use open government reforms to meet the challenge of increasing public integrity in its national action plan, as an important element in increasing transparency and lowering corruption in Australia – and in particular by implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, ensuring greater transparency in public procurement, and committing to a public register of corporate beneficial owners.</p>
<p>Right to Information</p>
<p>In 2014 the Federal Government withdrew funding and introduced legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and to reassign its functions to other government agencies and departments.  The legislation has failed to pass the Parliament, and is unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future, leaving the OAIC ‘in limbo’ and the national FOI, privacy and information policy regimes in jeopardy.  Abolition of the OAIC and dispersal of its strategic and operational functions between existing agencies and departments risks fragmentation of access to information rights and tools, which have historically been crucial in preventing and exposing corruption.<br />
TIA recommends that as part of its development of the draft National Action Plan the Australian Government should renew its full support for a strong access to information regime by withdrawing legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, re-instating funding for the OAIC to fulfill its mandate in relation to freedom of information, privacy, and information policy, and ensuring the prompt appointment of a new Australian Information Commissioner with full powers, located in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p>
<p>Multi-stakeholder oversight group</p>
<p>Experience in developing OGP National Action Plans elsewhere suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance and add value to the partnership.  The role of civil society in Australia’s OGP is critical, not just to ensure Australia’s OGP membership, but because the initiative is chaired equally between government and civil society in each country.</p>
<p>The proposed consultation process for the development of Australia’s first NAP is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not provide for effective joint civil society and government input into, and oversight of, the development of the first NAP.  Providing opportunities for feedback and comment is not a substitute for participation in finalising a draft NAP for government consideration.  TIA therefore recommends that at least one civil society representative is invited to join the group of officials charged with finalising the draft NAP for government consideration.</p>
<p>In the longer term, TIA recommends the establishment of a multi-stakeholder oversight group, comprising government, civil society, the private sector and the communications sector, to ensure ongoing commitment to fulfilling OGP obligations.</p>
<p>TIA affirms the need to involve a range of departments and agencies across Government.  An example of where such interdepartmental engagement would be beneficial would be necessary and beneficial is ensuring a link between the OPG process and the fulfillment of Australia’s commitment to develop a plan to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.  That process should also be multi-stakeholder involving government civil society and the private sector.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Great news that the government is moving in this direction and we look forward to progressing this issue together. </p>
<p>However, I must agree with Peter that the selection of the Grand Challenges without any consultation is an issue and somewhat contrary to the spirit of the OGP. It could be argued the the current two Grand Challenges do not sufficiently address transparency or corruption, especially when one considers that the OGP&#8217;s self-description prioritises transparency, corruption AND governance, (&#8220;&#8230; a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.&#8221;)</p>
<p>It was heartening to see mention made of natural resources &#8211; this is an area that Australia could specialise in and contribute to the global movement. With Working Groups on this issue just being established in the global OGP movement, it would be great if we could push the envelope.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This looks like a good consultation process Pia and Co. It is clear what will happen next and how we might get involved, it&#8217;s been well promoted (but I am actively tuned in), there is sufficient time for those interested to consider information presented, there are multiple methods (and points in the process) to provide input and for Gov to consolidate, respond to and consider it.<br />
I hope we will also see good use of citizen engagement, technology and data to understand social issues / community needs and refining service delivery; and support the potential in our community to manage public resources. I would also like to see public participation in the way we deliver, report and monitor delivery of this National Action Plan &#8211; not just public reporting.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks Peter, all great input. We&#8217;ll try consolidate everything into the wiki to launch for Stage 2. It is worth noting in the spirit of a collaborative approach, we are asking you for your ideas about vision, not trying to impose one. </p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Vision<br />
There is not much in the way of a vision in the published material.</p>
<p>Perhaps we couldn&#8217;t do much better than draw on the Open Government Declaration thus:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Australian Government with input from its citizens is committed to improved democratic practices in line with the OGP Open Government Declaration:<br />
	•“to promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and harness the power of new technologies to make government more effective and accountable.”<br />
	•“to uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create safer communities”<br />
	•“to embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our own countries and in an increasingly interconnected world.”</p>
<p>Grand Challenges<br />
It is disappointing that the published material in parts suggests important decisions about &#8216;grand challenges&#8217; that may limit commitments the government is prepared to consider have been made without any consultation. </p>
<p>For example these statements:<br />
&#8220;through consultation, the aim is for the first Australian Government’s National Action Plan to include ambitious actions that support the OGP grand challenges of improving public services and better managing public resources… Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of what will improve public services and improve management of public resources, as well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities for business and support innovation in Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>However another sentence brings transparency and accountability and public engagement into the picture:<br />
&#8220;Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public service delivery, increase the transparency and accountability of government, and encourage greater public engagement. It also an opportunity for the public, civil society, and the private sector to contribute ideas for how government can achieve those goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unilateral decisions about the scope of what will be considered would be an unfortunate start to a &#8220;partnership.&#8221; </p>
<p>Consultation should commence and proceed on the basis of OGP guidance that the plan in its final form should &#8220;consist of a set of commitments that advance transparency, accountability, participation and/or technological innovation.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/develop-a-national-action-plan" rel="nofollow">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/develop-a-national-action-plan</a></p>
<p>Within that broad framework nothing should be ruled out before consultation starts.<br />
As the process moves toward finality there should be no difficulty in grouping agreed commitments in a way that addresses one or more of the &#8216;challenges&#8217;, the only OGP requirement.</p>
<p>Framework<br />
According to the published material:<br />
&#8220;The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) is the lead Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&amp;C will work with other agencies across the Australian Public Service and other jurisdictions within Australia to develop the NAP….&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the wide range of issues likely to arise, consideration should be given to establishing formal inter-departmental, inter-governmental and government-civil society mechanisms to play a part at various stages during the development of proposals, the determination of priorities and action taken to implement commitments.</p>
<p>OGP related issues should not be considered in isolation. </p>
<p>For example during the period ahead the government will develop  plans to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.<br />
<a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/</a></p>
<p>An OGP initiative encourages member countries to link both by signing the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2013 Agenda for Sustainable Development<br />
<a href="../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_declaration.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_declaration.pdf</a> </p>
<p>Goal 16 and a number of the related targets are particularly relevant in the context of the development of Australia&#8217;s national action plan.<br />
Goal16: &#8220;Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>SDG targets for this goal include:<br />
Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all;<br />
Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms;<br />
Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels;<br />
Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels;<br />
Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance;<br />
Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.</p>
<p>Australia should sign the Declaration.</p>
<p>The Government should establish a formal mechanism that ensures co-ordinated consideration of OGP, SDG and related strategic policy challenges. A high level inter agency group would assist this process.</p>
<p>If &#8216;other jurisdictions&#8217; are to be part of the framework (the OGP is talking of sub-national and city engagement) that too may require a formal mechanism to bring state, territory, city and local government along.</p>
<p>And a joint government stakeholder group or forum to guide the partnership process and final decisions on the plan would give proper recognition to the fact that OGP decisions require joint ownership befitting a partnership.</p>
