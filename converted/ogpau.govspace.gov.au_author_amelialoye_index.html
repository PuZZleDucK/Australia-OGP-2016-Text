				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last Monday, 11th April 2016, we held the co-creation workshop for Australia&#8217;s first National Action Plan (NAP) for Open Government. Stakeholders from civil society and Government came together in Canberra to discuss suggest actions, prioritise them and draft commitment templates. It was momentous day. Our agenda was ambitious and the results excellent. We were productive because of the goodwill and hard work of those in the room.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had really positive feedback about the workshop from participants in both civil society and government. The team leading development of the NAP at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) have are pleased with the event, participation and the outputs generated.</p>
<p><strong>Participants in the co-creation workshop </strong><br />
Everyone who provided a suggested action was invited to attend the workshop. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>36 from Civil Society &#8211; NGO&#8217;s and individuals who had suggested Open Gov actions</li>
<li>4 from PM&amp;C including the Deputy Secretary for Innovation and Transformation</li>
<li>15 from Federal Government agencies including: Digital Transformation Office; Department of Finance; National Archives; Department of Industry, Innovation and Science</li>
<li>1 from the Assistant Minister Taylor&#8217;s Office</li>
<li>The Information Commissioner from NSW</li>
<li>2 from the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit</li>
<li>2 from State Governments</li>
<li>2 from engage2 to facilitate and manage the process</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prioritisation of actions and development of commitment templates </strong><br />
Participants at the workshop discussed the <a href="../../category/submissions/index.html" target="_blank">210 actions suggested by civil society</a> and those suggested by agencies through the <a href="../../second-idc/index.html" target="_blank">InterDepartmental Committee (IDC). </a>Actions were grouped into 18 proposals which were then prioritised by participants and turned into 14 commitment templates. The agenda, outputs of the workshop and details of attendees are available on <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=ace219a644fa786aeac66dd71aafacc1" target="_blank">this page of the wiki. </a></p>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong><br />
The proposals, priorities and commitment templates that came out of the workshop have now been taken by PM&amp;C to executives in agencies nominated to lead their delivery. Only 5-15 commitments will be included in the NAP and these will be decided by Cabinet, who must sign off on the NAP before it is submitted to the OGP in July.</p>
<p>See the most recent draft of the National Action Plan <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667" target="_blank">on this wiki. </a></p>
<p><strong>Ongoing engagement for OGPAU </strong><br />
During the workshop we discussed how Open Government Partnership might be managed in future, captured lessons learned and explored opportunities for ongoing engagement. The notes from this session have been recorded on <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cbe9cf80d51d9a1742b8d0b6dd54d676" target="_blank">this page of the wiki, </a>and we would like to invite those of you not in the room to contribute to this discussion. PM&amp;C are using this information to develop a commitment around ongoing engagement and their advice Government about the coordination of OGP delivery. I will also reflect this input in my engagement report. Please provide your thoughts before the 14th May so we can use it in our recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the delivery of Open Gov across Australia </strong><br />
After Monday&#8217;s workshop, our international guests from the OGP Support Unit and I met with stakeholders working toward driving open government across Australia. The <a href="https://opengovernment.org.au/" target="_blank">Australian Open Government Partnership Network</a> (civil society) also coordinated events in Sydney and Melbourne. We discussed ongoing engagement for OGP, how we might raise awareness about Open Government in Australia and the Sub-National OGP program.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge and thank those of you who participated in this process especially those of you involved in Monday&#8217;s event. PM&amp;C and I have been really impressed by your contributions, insights and the commitment you have shown to Open Government in Australia. It&#8217;s been an honour getting to know you all and learning more about your work. Throughout this project I have been capturing <a href="../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html#comment-373" target="_blank">what I have learned about Open Government in Australia.</a> This input will also be included in my engagement report in late May.  Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to include.</p>
<p>To build upon the goodwill created throughout this project and advance Open Government in Australia I would like to share your contact details with PM&amp;C, the Federal Agencies responsible for OGPAU commitments, teams coordinating Open Government in State Government, and others in Civil Society keen to connect with you on this topic. If you would like to provide consent for any or all of these uses of your personal information, please complete <a href="https://app.surveygizmo.com/builder/build/id/2719702" target="_blank">this 2 minute survey</a> so I know who to share your details with. This survey will be open until the 14th May.</p>

			<p>Submissions for the Australia’s first National Action Plan for Open Government have now closed. You can view and comment on the suggested actions on the <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">wiki</a>. This marks the end of <a href="../../contribute/index.html" target="_blank">Stage 2 of our engagement process</a>, which was designed to raise awareness and gather suggestions for actions for the National Action Plan. Submissions were open from December and 31<sup>st</sup> March.</p>
<p>We received 210 suggested actions, and from 93 individuals and organisations. The level of investment of those who participated in this process has been really impressive and the insight and experience of participants is evident in the quality of submissions we received. There is considerable passion and commitment to open government from our community.</p>
<p>We have now commenced <a href="../../contribute/index.html" target="_blank">Stage 3 </a>of the process to develop the National Action Plan (NAP) and are working with those who suggested actions to prioritise them and draft the NAP document. Individuals and organisations who suggested an action have now been invited to join agency staff at a co-creation workshop in Canberra this Monday, the 11<sup>th</sup> April 2016.</p>
<p>During this workshop participants will work together to develop the National Action Plan, completing <a href="../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html" class="broken_link"><u>commitment templates</u></a> provided by the international<a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"> Open Government Partnership. </a>Representatives from civil society and government agencies will discuss all suggested actions so they can be grouped and prioritised. Two members of the International Open Government Partnership Support Unit will also be at the workshop to lend their support with this process.</p>
<p>This week PM&amp;C held their second Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) meeting to discuss actions suggested, existing Open Government initiatives to include in the background section and build upon, and the priorities of government agencies for the NAP in the lead up to the workshop. On Wednesday, this <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667" target="_blank">wiki</a> page was updated with the most recent version of the background and methodology sections of the National Action Plan document. A <a href="../../category/updates/index.html">blog update</a> was also sent out by PM&amp;C to share who attended the IDC, what was discussed, and potential commitments that the Agencies have come up with in response to submissions received and from their own research and analysis.</p>
<p>During Monday&#8217;s workshop participants will also hear from the Deputy Secretary of Innovation and Transformation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and representatives of various Federal Government Departments about how Open Government is being implemented in Australia and government priorities for the NAP.</p>
<p>All actions suggestions will be discussed at the workshop on Monday, but the National Action Plan can only include 5-15 commitments. Even if a suggested action is not included in the NAP, if there is group support on Monday to co-create a draft commitment template, PM&amp;C has agreed to brief nominated lead agencies about them after the event.</p>
<p>The agenda for this workshop is available <a href="../../files/2016/04/Agenda-cocreation-workshop.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">here</a>. The opening of this workshop will be live webcast through GoogleHangout from 9:00 – 10:15am so you can see the opening and ask questions of our speakers. <a href="https://t.co/TrhH6d1aZc">Here is the link to the GoogeHangout </a>&#8211; a public event anyone can attend online.</p>
<p>We will provide you with an update about the outcomes of this process after the workshop next week.</p>

			<p>If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.</p>
<p>The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.</p>
<p>I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.</p>
<p>The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>13:00 &#8211; 14:00 Fiscal Transparency</li>
<li>14:30 &#8211; 15:30 Fostering innovation</li>
<li>15:30 &#8211; 16:30 Freedom of Information</li>
<li>16:30 &#8211; 17:30 Government Integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:</p>
<ul>
<li>12:00 &#8211; 13:00 Open Data</li>
<li>13:00 &#8211; 14:00 Public Service Delivery</li>
<li>14:30 &#8211; 15:30 Resource Management</li>
<li>15:30 &#8211; 16:30 Public Participation</li>
<li>17:00 &#8211; 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU</li>
</ul>
<p>I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.</p>
<p>I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between 11am &#8211; 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.</p>

			<p>We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=400b0cddf5e7a338daf5895375da5a64">wiki. </a>Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st March.</p>
<p><strong>Save the date!</strong> Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.</p>
<p>Need help? This <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf">how to Suggest an Action document provides some tips</a>. It’s an easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.</p>
<p>In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=3fd642b71c09fa7485cd3a6a758f861e">Engagement for OGP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=99b2404d03fa9b13d367b3703c0c7c24">Fiscal Transparency</a></li>

</ul>
<p>We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each action suggested.</p>
<p>Toby and the Open Government team at PM&amp;C have been discussing these themes with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to get involved. PM&amp;C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the 11th April workshop.</p>
<h2>Some questions that emerged during engagement last week</h2>
<ul>
<li>After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?</li>
<li>How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of the Grand Challenges?</li>
<li>What happened to the proposed teleconference?</li>
<li>How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responses to your questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Cocreation &#8211;</em> The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team, but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP <u><a href="../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">commitment templates</a> </u>with you.</p>
<p><em>Grand challenges &#8211;</em> The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will share more about Government’s position on this soon.</p>
<p><em>Teleconference &#8211; </em>I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities, differences and priorities before the 11th April event.</p>
<p><em>Working together to prioritise actions</em> &#8211; We need to work together to prioritise suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment on actions on the wiki &#8211; I will start asking questions discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.</li>
<li>In a theme based teleconference &#8211; I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions that you have inspired me to take</h2>
<p>Based on your input to date I am now:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Encouraging theme based engagement </em>– I will be running teleconferences with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about this.</li>
<li><em>Encouraging feedback from others on actions – </em><em>actions have now been themed into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise with you at the workshop. </em></li>
<li><em>Connecting Australians to the </em><em><u><a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups" target="_blank">working groups</a> </u></em><em>and Open Government Partnership Support Unit, </em><em>Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Bas</em><em>u</em><em>: <a href="mailto:shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org">shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org</a></em></li>
<li><em>Investigating privacy and consent requirements </em>for publishing stakeholder details – I am still pursing this with PM&amp;C.</li>
<li><em>Researching ongoing engagement forums</em> being used in other Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian Open Government Partnership Networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.</p>
<p>Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.</p>

			<p>Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have been suggested and I&#8217;m aware of a few more currently being drafted.</p>
<p>I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an interest in <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration">Open Government Principles or the OGP Grand Challenges</a> so they can help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.</p>
<p>The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218 people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with 87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a <a href="../../files/2015/10/Introduction_to_OGPAU.pdf">one page Introduction to the OGPAU </a>document and <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf">How to Suggest an Action template with tips</a> to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks – just let me know how I can help.</p>
<p>I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.</p>
<p>I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact each other. I have contacted PM&amp;C’s privacy team to confirm this approach whether this requires your consent.</p>
<p>As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want to help.</p>
<p>Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public participation industry across the country. I have been working with the Australasian division <a href="https://www.iap2.org.au/">International Association for Public Participation (IAP2)</a> who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.</p>
<p>I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven&#8217;t suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so, so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.</p>
<p>Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&amp;C can discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This <a href="../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf" target="_blank">How to Suggest an Action </a>document should help, or you could look at the <a href="https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=8e83d78c3ede9c7250ad00b965a4b42f" target="_blank">wiki</a> for ideas to build upon. PM&amp;C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.</p>
<p>The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested. I&#8217;m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about <a href="../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html" target="_blank">What I have learned about Open Gov in Australia </a>which I will update as I continue to engage.</p>
<h2>Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline</h2>
<p>My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key <em>themes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Public Participation</em> –increased input into both policy and agenda setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff</li>
<li><em>Government Integrity</em> – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption, parliamentary openness</li>
<li><em>Freedom of Information</em> – review of the act, role of the commissioners, privacy, copyright review</li>
<li><em>Fiscal Transparency</em> – open budget, political donations</li>
<li><em>Public Service Delivery</em> – how Gov work with community and industry, how citizens find services</li>
<li><em>Resources Management</em> – sustainable development, working with indigenous communities, see also <em>OpenData</em> and <em>Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency</em></li>
<li><em>Open Data</em> – standardised formats, public register and open raw data, publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource and extractive industry data</li>
<li><em>Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency</em> &#8211; extractive industry data and transparency initiative</li>
<li><em>Fostering innovation</em> – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs, support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver services</li>
<li><em>Engagement for OGP</em> – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see suggested actions in more details on the<a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html"> WIKI.</a></p>
<h2>Actions you have inspired me to take</h2>
<p>Based on your input to date I am now:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Supporting</em> a number of organisations with development of their submissions</li>
<li><em>Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills</em> – e.g. My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals to the International OGP Working Groups.</li>
<li><em>Co-hosting events</em> – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number of the organisations listed.</li>
<li><em>Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference &#8211;</em> will now be a teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar ideas</li>
<li><em>Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups </em></li>
<li><em>Researching similar actions</em> outlined in Action Plans prepared by other countries</li>
<li><em>Investigating privacy and consent requirements </em>for publishing stakeholder details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.</li>
<li><em>Researching ongoing engagement forums</em> being used in other Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others you like.</li>
<li><em>Researching OGP NAP review reports</em> to understand how Australia might be assessed and what actions should include.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might be more involved.</p>
<p>Amelia</p>

			<p>I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government initiatives inside Government across Australia.</p>
<p>I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>A proactive release framework and supporting tools including Data release guidelines.</li>
<li>An Open Data Portal &#8211; Due for release in early 2016 the Open Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and innovation in the area of information access.

<li>Embedding Creative Commons licencing &#8211; Open OEH has implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the OEH website.</li>
<li>Increasing public participation &#8211; OEH are using online methods to engage including applications like Nature Near that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them through social media.</li>
<li>Open Governance Framework &#8211; This framework will provide drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify and train key staff who can help determine barriers and enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider. Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and speed up approval for the release of open data.</li>

			<p><strong>OGP engagement update &#8211; 1st March </strong><br />
<em>by Amelia Loye engage2 </em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) to engage civil society in Open Government.</p>
<p>I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and email update.</p>
<p>You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live on the <a href="../../contribute/get-involved/index.html" target="_blank">website.</a></p>
<p>I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at <a href="mailto:amelia@engage2.com.au">amelia@engage2.com.au</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging your networks: </strong>I have been working with a range of different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open Government Working Groups.</p>
<p><strong>Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:</strong> The document is being drafted <a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html">live</a><a href="../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html" target="_blank"> on the wiki</a> so you can observe and comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across the Country.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with your input:</strong> I collate all input received and report back weekly to PM&amp;C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.</p>
<p>Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open Government Partnership, PM&amp;C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your input to date.</p>
<p>As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.</p>
<p>Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Amelia Loye<br />
