****** Submissions for the Interim Working Group are now closed ******
Posted on August_24,_2016  by  ogpteam
Stakeholder expressions of interest to join the Interim Working Group for
Australia’s National Action Plan have now closed, with approximately 40
submissions received.
We are extremely pleased with the quality of the submissions, the diversity of
applicants and the extensive experience they offer.
The large number of submissions reflects the ongoing interest and public
engagement with Australia’s process to join the Open Government Partnership.
Regardless of who is selected for the Interim Working Group, we look forward to
continuing to work with all interested parties as we co-draft Australia’s first
National Action Plan.
We are endeavouring to notify applicants of the outcome of their submission
over the coming days. PM&C is also engaging with key agencies to finalise the
government members of the Interim Working Group.
As always, any enquiries can be submitted to this blog or to OGP@pmc.gov.au.
