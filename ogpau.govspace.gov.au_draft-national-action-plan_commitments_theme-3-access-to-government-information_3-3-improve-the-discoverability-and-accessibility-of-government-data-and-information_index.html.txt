3.3 – Improve the discoverability and accessibility of government data and information {#improve-the-discoverability-and-accessibility-of-government-data-and-information .entry-title}
======================================================================================

<div class="entry-content">

*We will make it easier for the public to find and use government data
and information through central portals and digital platforms.*

**Objective\
**Australia will establish platforms and tools to improve the
discoverability and accessibility of government information and public
data.

**Status Quo\
**The creation, preservation, management and public use of government
information is fundamental to open and transparent government. The
availability of government records and data improves public access to
information, while also driving efficient business outcomes by
facilitating use and reuse of these valuable resources.

It is not enough just to make these resources open; information and
public data must be easy to find and accessible in order for it to be
useful. Some specific examples of areas where the government is seeking
to improve public access to information include:

-   Public data: Data.gov.au is the Australian Government’s open
    data platform. It has enabled the open release of over 20,000 public
    resources used to grow the economy, improve service delivery and
    transform policy outcomes for the nation. As the number of datasets
    on [data.gov.au](http://data.gov.au/) grows, Australia’s public data
    infrastructure needs be upgraded to meet the demands of data users.
    This includes improving search and discovery, enhancing support for
    collaboration, developing a quality framework to assist publishers,
    and developing more robust publishing processes.
-   Grants: There is no central point to identify and apply for
    Australian Government grant opportunities and find consolidated
    information about grants awarded. The Department of Finance is
    building GrantConnect, a central whole-of-government system that
    will forecast and publish grant opportunities, automatically notify
    public users of grant opportunities of interest, and publish
    information on grants awarded.
-   Corporate and administrative reporting: Corporate and administrative
    reporting information is currently located on individual agency
    websites or in hard copy, making it difficult to compare and
    contrast documents. The Department of Finance and the Department of
    the Prime Minister and Cabinet are working with the Digital
    Transformation Agency to make reporting information more
    discoverable and accessible through the digitisation of
    this information.
-   Archived records: The most significant records of the Australian
    Government are held by the National Archives of Australia. To
    facilitate citizens’ access to these records through digital and
    online channels, the Archives will continue to lead the transition
    from paper to digital information practices in Australian Government
    agencies, digitise paper records of high research value and increase
    the number of records available for public access.
-   Environmental information: The Department of the Environment and
    Energy compiles significant data to produce its State of the
    Environment report and meet its other responsibilities (such as
    research into the impacts of coal and coal seam gas developments on
    ground water). The Department will make the 2017 State of the
    Environment report and its underlying data more accessible through
    SoE Digital (an innovative and interactive online platform)
    and data.gov.au. It will use data visualisation tools to help
    publish the results of its coal and coal seam gas
    bioregional assessments.

**Ambition\
**To make it as easy as possible to find, access and use government
information and data.

**Relevance\
**This commitment will advance the OGP values of **access to
information** and **technology and innovation** by:

-   promoting a consistent approach to information governance across
    Australian Government entities;
-   increasing transparency of government decision-making and policy
    development;
-   enabling information and data reuse for economic and social
    benefits;
-   protecting the rights and entitlements of Australians to access
    government information;
-   increasing the accessibility, usability and discoverability of
    public data; and
-   improving the quality of data.

**OGP Grand Challenge**

-   Improving Public Services
-   Increasing Public Integrity
-   More Effectively Managing Public Resources

**Timeframes\
**Mid 2016 – Mid 2018

**Lead agency\
**Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C), Department of
Finance (Finance), National Archives of Australia (Archives) and
Department of the Environment and Energy (DoEE)

**Other actors involved**\
*Government: *All Commonwealth entities

*Non-government:* Data61

**Milestones**

1.  PM&C to work with Data61 to conduct research and discovery into data
    consumption (to better understand user behaviours and needs) and
    publishing (to improve quality, timeliness and value of
    published data).
    -   Mid 2016 – Mid 2017

2.  PM&C to work with Data61 to create, circulate and gather feedback on
    design concepts and prototypes for improved search functionality and
    user experience on the data.gov.au platform.
    -   Late 2016 – Late 2017

3.  Finance to implement Phase One of the GrantConnect platform to
    enable public users to: register to receive notifications on grant
    opportunities that match their self-defined profiles; watch forecast
    opportunities as they move from planning to requests for
    applications; and access grant guidelines for each opportunity and
    be notified about changes to grants processes.
    -   Late 2016 – Late 2017

4.  Finance to launch the pilot of the digital corporate and
    administrative reporting platform.
    -   Late 2016 – Late 2017

5.  Archives to lead the transition to digital information practices in
    Australian Government agencies to ensure robust information
    governance and report to the Prime Minister in 2018.
    -   Mid 2016 – Late 2018

6.  Archives to increase the number of archival records available in
    digital formats, including World War II service and passenger
    arrival records.
    -   Mid 2016 – Late 2018

7.  Archives to make additional groups of archival records of high
    research interest available for public access.
    -   Mid 2016 – Late 2018

8.  PM&C to deliver live platform elements for data.gov.au, including
    integration with NationalMap to provide a more efficient workflow
    for the publishing and discovery of spatial data.
    -   Early 2017 – Late 2017

9.  PM&C to design and prototype further data.gov.au platform
    capabilities, including: functionality to promote examples and
    collaboration using public data; and integration with other
    platforms for open data projects and third party open
    data platforms.
    -   Early 2017 – Mid 2018

10. DoEE to launch a map-based tool to visualise Bioregional
    Assessment results.
    -   Early 2017 – June 2017

11. DoEE to publish the State of the Environment report through an
    online information publishing and reporting platform and release the
    underlying data on data.gov.au.
    -   November 2016 – February/March 2017
