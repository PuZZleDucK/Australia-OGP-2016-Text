This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian
Open Government Network on February 2 2016.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

**Australian Open Government network**

I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).

The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals
and organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the
development of Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National
Action Plan and participating in efforts to enhance and improve
democratic practices in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.

The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and
ideas on areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed
in the true spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the
determination of priorities for consideration.

Current Steering Committee members are:

-   Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
-   Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
-   Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
-   Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism,
    Monash University)
-   Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
-   Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
-   Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
-   Peter Timmins, Convener

A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in
the process of doing so.

At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the
Civil Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.

The Network has a webpage at [www.aogpn.net](http://www.aogpn.net/) and
will shortly have a more comprehensive web presence, encouraging other
organisations and individuals to contribute to the second phase of the
consultation now underway.

The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as
the government moves ahead on this important initiative.

**Low key initiative**\
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve
how government operates including through citizen engagement, the
announcement of Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to
a low key start.

While December/January present problems for effective communication, the
topic and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage
and encourage participation from potentially interested stakeholder
organisations and members of the public.

While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four
information sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the
Prime Minister and entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key
start to what should be substantial national engagement activity.

The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to
the OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation.
There has been no public media statements on the topic by the Prime
Minister or any of his Cabinet Ministers.

While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee
Co-chairs announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP
Membership is readily available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious
on the website of the Prime Minister, the Department of Prime Minister
and Cabinet or on the consultation website.

As such the government appears to have done little to bring the
initiative to public attention.

Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.

The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short
notice were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne and Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not
constitute a national campaign of engagement.

Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the
OGP in recent years have located the Australian government’s
consultation materials published online. However these materials are not
readily available to interested parties who have not been informed of
the process by the government.

In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation
represents a challenge even for those aware of the process.

While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process,
there is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is
largely taking place.

It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement
puts at risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the
probability of Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the
OGP on the grounds of insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s
initial OGP membership attempt.

**General approach**\
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation,
announced it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did
not include Public Integrity.

Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course
of consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently
published Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While
it is pleasing to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the
table, this should have been the starting position for consultation and
public engagement.

The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide
the necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the
OGP initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So
too is the lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and
civil society together at various decision points during the public
consultation, decision making and implementation phases of the National
Action Plan. The OGP itself with a mix of government and CSO members and
government and CSO co-chairs provides an exemplary model and there are
examples from other OGP members that Australia could emulate quickly and
without disrupting the current process and timeline.

The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and
civil society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting
proposed for the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early
March.

The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian
states, territories and local government must be part of the open
government journey. The OGP is encouraging the involvement of
sub-national governments in open government initiatives. While the
National Action Plan should be the Australian Government’s plan, states,
territories and local government should be part of a discussion and
debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.

The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the
future of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious
concern that should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership
process by withdrawal of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all
OAIC functions.

The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime
Minister’s proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and
transparent government.”

As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John
McMillan, wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to
languish or to go through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30
years.”

**Vision and Background**\
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and
Background material.

At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published
materials of the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted
unanimously at the UN General Assembly last year, to the United Nations
Convention Against Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work
of the G20 on anti corruption matters.

The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government
for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Forty eight governments have endorsed the declaration to date including
Indonesia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia
should follow this lead.

Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption
plan required by the convention.

The Attorney general’s Department website\
<https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx>
makes much of Australia’s leadership role in the development of the G20
2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.

The Plan states:

> “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our government
> agencies, policies, and officials implement international best
> practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The (Anti
> Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement, open
> data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public officials,
> fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public officials as
> issues which merit particular attention.”

The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further
states:

> “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
> committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
> corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20
> Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles
> on Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help
> our companies comply with global standards on ethics and
> anti-corruption. Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public
> sectors is essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period.
Our team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly
started 2016 by making significant headway on a number of priorities.

This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us
in designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement
throughout Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community
Prioritisation and Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies
to enhance our engagement processes and will regularly keep those of you
interested updated via the blog and mailing list.

The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held
late last year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we
have set up a live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its
drafting. We will keep all stakeholders informed about the ongoing
development of the Plan, and opportunities to get more involved.

One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at
the end of February.  We will have more information on this very
shortly.

We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate
alongside Civil Society in this process.

At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to
connect with the Open Government Partnership working groups to
contribute to peer exchange and learning across the partnership. Key
areas include:

-   Fiscal Openness,
-   Legislative Openness,
-   Access to Information,
-   Open Data and
-   Openness in Natural Resources

More information is available at
<http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups>

If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog,
send us an email to <ogp@pmc.gov.au>.  We’re looking for measureable
actions that the Australian Government can deliver and report against.

You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at
[https://ogpau.wikispaces.com](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)
