On Tuesday 5 April, the Government convened a second interdepartmental
committee (IDC) meeting on the Open Government Partnership. The meeting
covered the public submissions received to date, discussed attendance at
the public workshop to be held on Monday 11 April, and talked more
broadly about the Open Government Partnership process going forward, and
how agencies will be involved.

In attendance were:

-   Attorney-General’s Department
-   Australian Bureau of Statistics
-   Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity
-   Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
-   Australian Public Service Commission
-   Department of Education and Training
-   Department of Employment
-   Department of Finance
-   Department of Health
-   Department of Human Services
-   Department of Immigration and Border Protection
-   Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
-   Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development
-   Department of the Environment
-   Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
-   Digital Transformation Office
-   National Archives of Australia
-   Office of the Australian Information Commissioner

Also discussed at the meeting were a range of potential commitments that
the Agencies have come up with either in response to submissions
received, or from their own research and analysis.

The outlines of these are below, and they will be open for discussion at
the public workshop.

-   Centralised Annual Report discovery portal
-   Create a Digital Marketplace
-   Create, manage and preserve information digitally
-   Enable and encourage more data-driven digital report publishing
-   Future-proofing open data infrastructure
-   Grants.gov.au redevelopment
-   ICT Project dashboard
-   Redesign the open data request process
-   Scoping a public consultation platform
-   Scoping an e-Tabling system
-   Transforming high volume services

In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the
commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki
and other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy
to read, in line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is
available for download at [National Action Plan DRAFT v5 – For
Release](../../files/2016/04/National-Action-Plan-DRAFT-v5-For-Release.docx)

We have also posted the text onto the wiki at
[http://ogpau.wikispaces.com/Draft+text+of+the+National+Action+Plan+-+5+April+2016](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=f1d0b38e3a2eb9fbef4b9df781356667) for
your comments and feedback prior to the meeting on Monday.

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for
Open Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with
others whose actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.

The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought
it would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions
suggested prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The
intent is to increase the lines of communication between you before you
meet in person at the event in Canberra on the 11th April.

I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you
might like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through
the wiki.

The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:

-   13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
-   14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
-   15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
-   16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity

The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:

-   12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
-   13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
-   14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
-   15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
-   17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU

I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at
the bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.

I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st
between 11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an
action so we can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.

I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next
meeting with the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia
on the
[wiki.](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=400b0cddf5e7a338daf5895375da5a64)Have
you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.

**Save the date!** Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to
help co-create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long
workshop on the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the
agencies most likely to lead actions. I will be in touch with those of
you who have suggested an action with more information. We know this
time frame is tight but it is necessary for us to meet Cabinet and OGP
timelines.

Need help? This [how to Suggest an Action document provides some
tips](../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf). It’s an easy
process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.

In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and
drafting on the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the
following themes:

-   [Engagement for
    OGP](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=3fd642b71c09fa7485cd3a6a758f861e)

-   [Resources
    Management](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=0e3314c1b29a0cbe2e92cf0f9a3dd95b8)

We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on
each action suggested.

Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these
themes with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that
area. Many have also expressed excitement about the actions suggested
and several are keen to get involved. PM&C are now working with these
agencies to prepare them for the 11th April workshop.

Some questions that emerged during engagement last week
-------------------------------------------------------

-   After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what
    is the process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to
    look like?
-   How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside
    of the Grand Challenges?
-   What happened to the proposed teleconference?
-   How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?

**Responses to your questions**

*Cocreation –* The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those
suggesting actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet
Open Government team, but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in
Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra will be where civil society and
representatives from government agencies come together. Everyone who
suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can only be 5-15
actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host theme
based discussions to shape the OGP NAP [commitment
templates](../../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Action%20Plan%20Template%20and%20Guidance%202014.html){.broken_link} with
you.

*Grand challenges –* The Government has made it clear the two Grand
Challenges are their focus, but they are willing to consider other
suggestions outside of these areas. At the workshop we will develop
commitments for all actions suggested, or groups of actions as we
prioritise and cluster them. Toby will share more about Government’s
position on this soon.

*Teleconference –* I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an
action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so
you can meet others who have suggested actions within the same themes,
to discuss similarities, differences and priorities before the 11th
April event.

*Working together to prioritise actions* – We need to work together to
prioritise suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them
down. I’d like to help you / civil society / us, to start discussing
that now before the workshop on the 11th April. There are two ways you
can get involved in this process:

-   Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
    discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how
    they might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage
    your involvement.
-   In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you
    who have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on
    the 29th or 30th March, to introduce you to others with similar
    suggestions, so we can discuss your ideas and priorities before the
    11th April event.

Actions that you have inspired me to take
-----------------------------------------

Based on your input to date I am now:

-   *Encouraging theme based engagement* – I will be running
    teleconferences with those who have suggested actions under a theme.
    If you have suggested an action, you will receive a separate email
    from me about this.
-   *Encouraging feedback from others on actions –* *actions have now
    been themed into groups with each posted as a discussion point on
    the wiki. We are looking for your thoughts about similarities,
    differences and opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow
    down and prioritise with you at the workshop.*

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60
actions have been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being
drafted.

I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in [Open Government Principles or the OGP Grand
Challenges](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about/open-government-declaration)
so they can help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest
actions.

The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or
organisations. 218 people have registered for updates, which is a 28%
increase since our January update, and I have emailed everyone on the
list to raise awareness about the project and encourage engagement. I
have personally discussed the project with 87 people, some who are
working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure there are many
more people and organisations across Australia who would be interested
in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a [one
page Introduction to the
OGPAU](../../files/2015/10/Introduction_to_OGPAU.pdf)document and [How
to Suggest an Action template with
tips](../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf) to support those
willing to help with this process. I am also happy to provide content
for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks – just let
me know how I can help.

I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local
Government Associations, and professional association, networks and
organisations with some interest in Open Government principles or the
Grand Challenges. I have been well received by teams delivering Open
Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still
trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory
so please do get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone interested if
you know anyone there.

I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop
their ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to
date has said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own
organisations and networks for now. In response, I have sought out
opportunities to engage with existing networks and I am connecting
people with similar interests to each other directly. I have also
prepared a list of organisations I have been talking to, to share for
transparency and so you are aware of and can contact each other. I have
contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach whether this
requires your consent.

As an example, I have also connected several people interested in
transparency and open data for extractive industries, shared open
government platforms and ways to enable innovation within agencies and
innovation with others who want to help.

Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division [International Association for Public
Participation (IAP2)](https://www.iap2.org.au/) who sent out a
newsletter to their network and invited members to express an interest
in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement
Conference on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public
participation suggestions already put forward and try to generate more
suggestions for actions to include in the National Action Plan.
Collabforge has offered to do the same with attendees of the Engage2Act
conference in Melbourne and we are also exploring whether there is
enough interest in an event about collaboration and Open Gov. Toby has
been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data sector through a
series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in the Actions
you have inspired section of this post below.

I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership
and those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you
haven’t suggested an action or been in touch with me about your
interests please do so, so I can introduce you to others. I am also
happy to attend your events and workshop actions with you and others
with aligned interests.

Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so
far with Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in
the next draft of the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already
suggested an action please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest
in the project and PM&C can discuss suggestions with agencies. One
paragraph is fine for now. This [How to Suggest an
Action](../../files/2016/02/Suggest-an-OGPAU-action-.pdf)document should
help, or you could look at the
[wiki](https://session.wikispaces.com/1/auth/auth?authToken=cc5e5d1fa2e5184eaee6859f30c7c791)
for ideas to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these
suggestions to determine which of these they will work with you to
workshop in April.

The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the
actions you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to
everyone who has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you
who have met with or made time to talk to me about the project and
others who may be interested. I’m really enjoying learning more about
Open Government in Australia. I thought you might too, so I have also
drafted this blog post about [What I have learned about Open Gov in
Australia](../../what-im-learning-about-open-gov-in-australia/index.html)which
I will update as I continue to engage.

Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline

*themes:*

    add your names to this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder
    list publicly.
-   *Researching ongoing engagement forums* being used in other
    Countries to engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership
    after action plans are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil
    society team, and some of the people involved in the NZ and the UK.
    Let me know if there are others you like.
-   *Researching OGP NAP review reports* to understand how Australia
    might be assessed and what actions should include.

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open
Government initiatives inside Government across Australia.

I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC,
SA, ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best
contacts in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or
put me in touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.

Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government
is being delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being
delivered within Australia as part of the international and National
Open Government movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.

    -   Have your say:
        http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/search
    -   Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
        https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
    -   Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
        Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report
        on performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a
        culture of accountability by providing a single snapshot of real
        time data across NSW Government.
    -   Publish open government plans to showcase open government
        initiatives\
        NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
        report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
        collaboration, participation and innovation.
    -   Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
        community engagement through social media channels. This policy
        contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social
        media in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible,
        reliable and appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to
        ensure currency and include guidance on analytics and
        other tools.
    -   Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
        promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
        progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
        forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
        schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with
        government data.
    -   Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
        updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and
        prioritise data released in more open formats. [This policy was
        released
        on 26/4/16.](../../../www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/sites/default/files/resources/NSW_Government_Open_Data_Policy_2016.pdf)
    -   NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
        Management, which is now being used in two other Australian
        States through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of
        services is now generating revenue for the NSW.
    -   Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
        proactive release of open data, increase public participation
        and collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
        -   A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
            Data release guidelines.
        -   An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
            Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment
            and innovation in the area of information access. The Open
            Data Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
            data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
            (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
        -   Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
            implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative
            Commons licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets
            available to the public), all public documents (post
            June 2015) and the OEH website.
        -   Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
            methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
            that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
            through social media.
        -   Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
            drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government
            in OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to
            identify and train key staff who can help determine barriers
            and enablers for Open Government for the executive
            to consider. Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to
            devolve responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red
            tape and speed up approval for the release of open data.
        -   Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
            resource management programs such as the coastal
            reforms project.

**OGP engagement update – 1st March**\
*by Amelia Loye engage2*

It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister
and Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.

I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and
organisations across Australia to raise awareness about the project and
encourage input into our National Action Plan. There are some really
amazing things happening across our Country and each week I will share
what I learn with you in this blog and email update.

You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action
Plan on Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement
strategy are now live on the
[website.](../../contribute/get-involved/index.html)

I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to
continue raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders
passionate about the Open Government principles so they can convene
conversations and collect input. The strategy is a live document and I
would welcome any other suggestions you have for how I might encourage
engagement in the development of the Action Plan. You can reach me on
phone 0411960585 or by email at <amelia@engage2.com.au>.

**Engaging your networks:** I have been working with a range of
different stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government
Partnership through their newsletters and at events. I am also working
with stakeholders who want to host events to workshop potential actions
with their industry or networks. If this sounds like you, but we have
not been in touch, please give me a call to discuss. You can also
connect with others across the globe working on Open Government actions
in areas that interest you through the International Open Government
Working Groups.

**Suggest an action and comment on the draft document:** The document is
being drafted [live](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)[on the
wiki](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html) so you can observe and
comment on the content. If you would like to discuss your action and
workshop your suggestions please get in touch with me directly. I’d love
to work with you and connect you to others with similar interests across
the Country.

**What’s happening with your input:** I collate all input received and
report back weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and
face-to-face meetings, and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and
email submissions.

Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the
Open Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a
summary of your input to date.

As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki
so there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal
submissions received will also be published publicly on the website as
they are received.

Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look
forward to hearing from and working with many more of you over the
coming weeks.

This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian
Open Government Network on February 2 2016.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

**Australian Open Government network**

I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).

The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals
and organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the
development of Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National
Action Plan and participating in efforts to enhance and improve
democratic practices in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.

The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and
ideas on areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed
in the true spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the
determination of priorities for consideration.

Current Steering Committee members are:

-   Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
-   Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
-   Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
-   Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism,
    Monash University)
-   Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
-   Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
-   Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
-   Peter Timmins, Convener

A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in
the process of doing so.

At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the
Civil Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.

The Network has a webpage at [www.aogpn.net](http://www.aogpn.net/) and
will shortly have a more comprehensive web presence, encouraging other
organisations and individuals to contribute to the second phase of the
consultation now underway.

The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as
the government moves ahead on this important initiative.

**Low key initiative**\
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve
how government operates including through citizen engagement, the
announcement of Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to
a low key start.

While December/January present problems for effective communication, the
topic and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage
and encourage participation from potentially interested stakeholder
organisations and members of the public.

While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four
information sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the
Prime Minister and entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key
start to what should be substantial national engagement activity.

The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to
the OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation.
There has been no public media statements on the topic by the Prime
Minister or any of his Cabinet Ministers.

While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee
Co-chairs announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP
Membership is readily available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious
on the website of the Prime Minister, the Department of Prime Minister
and Cabinet or on the consultation website.

As such the government appears to have done little to bring the
initiative to public attention.

Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.

The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short
notice were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne and Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not
constitute a national campaign of engagement.

Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the
OGP in recent years have located the Australian government’s
consultation materials published online. However these materials are not
readily available to interested parties who have not been informed of
the process by the government.

In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation
represents a challenge even for those aware of the process.

While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process,
there is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is
largely taking place.

It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement
puts at risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the
probability of Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the
OGP on the grounds of insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s
initial OGP membership attempt.

**General approach**\
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation,
announced it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did
not include Public Integrity.

Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course
of consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently
published Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While
it is pleasing to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the
table, this should have been the starting position for consultation and
public engagement.

The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide
the necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the
OGP initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So
too is the lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and
civil society together at various decision points during the public
consultation, decision making and implementation phases of the National
Action Plan. The OGP itself with a mix of government and CSO members and
government and CSO co-chairs provides an exemplary model and there are
examples from other OGP members that Australia could emulate quickly and
without disrupting the current process and timeline.

The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and
civil society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting
proposed for the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early
March.

The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian
states, territories and local government must be part of the open
government journey. The OGP is encouraging the involvement of
sub-national governments in open government initiatives. While the
National Action Plan should be the Australian Government’s plan, states,
territories and local government should be part of a discussion and
debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.

The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the
future of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious
concern that should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership
process by withdrawal of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all
OAIC functions.

The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime
Minister’s proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and
transparent government.”

As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John
McMillan, wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to
languish or to go through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30
years.”

**Vision and Background**\
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and
Background material.

At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published
materials of the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted
unanimously at the UN General Assembly last year, to the United Nations
Convention Against Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work
of the G20 on anti corruption matters.

The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government
for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Forty eight governments have endorsed the declaration to date including
Indonesia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia
should follow this lead.

Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption
plan required by the convention.

The Attorney general’s Department website\
<https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx>
makes much of Australia’s leadership role in the development of the G20
2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.

The Plan states:

> “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our government
> agencies, policies, and officials implement international best
> practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The (Anti
> Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement, open
> data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public officials,
> fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public officials as
> issues which merit particular attention.”

The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further
states:

> “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
> committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
> corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20
> Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles
> on Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help
> our companies comply with global standards on ethics and
> anti-corruption. Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public
> sectors is essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20
> Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles and the G20 Principles for
> Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing
> work on asset disclosure frameworks…”

The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20
High-Level Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20
Principles for Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20
Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles.

**Next steps**\
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as
the consultation proceeds.

Please publish this submission on the Open Government Partnership
Australia website.

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period.
Our team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly
started 2016 by making significant headway on a number of priorities.

This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us
in designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement
throughout Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community
Prioritisation and Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies
to enhance our engagement processes and will regularly keep those of you
interested updated via the blog and mailing list.

The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held
late last year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we
have set up a live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its
drafting. We will keep all stakeholders informed about the ongoing
development of the Plan, and opportunities to get more involved.

One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at
the end of February.  We will have more information on this very
shortly.

We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate
alongside Civil Society in this process.

At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to
connect with the Open Government Partnership working groups to
contribute to peer exchange and learning across the partnership. Key
areas include:

-   Fiscal Openness,
-   Legislative Openness,
-   Access to Information,
-   Open Data and
-   Openness in Natural Resources

More information is available at
<http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/ogp-working-groups>

If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog,
send us an email to <ogp@pmc.gov.au>.  We’re looking for measureable
actions that the Australian Government can deliver and report against.

You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at
[https://ogpau.wikispaces.com](../../../ogpau.wikispaces.com/index.html)
.

<div class="entry-content">

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the
Open Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in
Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation,
enthusiasm and contribution to the development of the Australian
Government’s National Action Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.

As a result of the discussions at these face to face information
sessions, we have created an email address
([ogp@pmc.gov.au](http://ogp@pmc.gov.au/)) as an additional
communication and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who
feel less comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using
the wikispaces.  Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via
this address and you can be assured that, at no time, will a single
contribution, suggestion or feedback be directly attributed to a person
or an organisation.

Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are
able to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan
([https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/](../../faqs/index.html)).

As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would
encourage all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting
their suggestions.  Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP
principles of: Transparency; Accountability; Participation; Technology;
and/or Innovation.  Submissions should also consider implementation
options and potential ways that progress can be measured.

There are a wealth of resources located
at <http://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/landing> which provide
details of the existing commitments developed by other countries in
their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that have been
through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom of
this email for more information on how to contribute.

Updates from the coordination team
----------------------------------

As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she
will be finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity
leave.  As a result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of
National Action Plan Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation
process over the course of the next 6 months.  I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Pia for her tireless dedication to the OGP process
she will be greatly missed, but has assured us that she will be keeping
an eye from afar.

I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the
design and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2
(drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (running the Community
Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once the outcome of this process is
known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.

Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over
the coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between
Christmas and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog,
twitter and email) will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send
out another email in January updating you on the consultation process
and providing more details on the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.
