On Tuesday 5 April, the Government convened a second interdepartmental
committee (IDC) meeting on the Open Government Partnership. The meeting covered

In addition, we are releasing a draft of the document to contain the
commitments once decided on.  The majority of the text is from the wiki and
other submissions, and has been kept deliberately concise and easy to read, in
line with other countries National Action Plans.  It is available for download

If you have suggested an action for Australian National Action Plan for Open
Government you will received an invite to a teleconference with others whose
actions relate to the same theme from me shortly.
The purpose of the teleconferences is to compliment the wiki. I thought it
would be good to introduce you to each other and discuss actions suggested
prior to the closing of submissions on the 31st March. The intent is to
increase the lines of communication between you before you meet in person at
the event in Canberra on the 11th April.
I apologise for the late notice but it is okay if you can not attend you might
like to introduce yourself and comment on other actions through the wiki.
The following teleconferences will be held on Tuesday the 29th March:
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Fiscal Transparency
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Fostering innovation
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Freedom of Information
    * 16:30 – 17:30 Government Integrity
The following teleconferences will be held on Wednesday the 30th March:
    * 12:00 – 13:00 Open Data
    * 13:00 – 14:00 Public Service Delivery
    * 14:30 – 15:30 Resource Management
    * 15:30 – 16:30 Public Participation
    * 17:00 – 18:00 Ongoing Engagement for OGPAU
I will host the teleconference and post a summary of the discussion at the
bottom of each theme page on the wiki at the end of each day.
I have also set aside some time in my calendar on Thursday the 31st between
11am – 1pm for anyone who might be thinking about suggesting an action so we
can workshop it before submissions close at 5pm.
I’ll be back in touch with invites as soon as I get out of my next meeting with
the Open Government Steering Committee in NSW.

We now have 70 suggested actions for how to Open Government in Australia on the
wiki.Have you made your suggestion yet? Submissions close at 5pm on the 31st
March.
Save the date! Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to help co-
create the National Action Plan (NAP) in Canberra for a day long workshop on
the 11th April with Federal Government staff from the agencies most likely to
lead actions. I will be in touch with those of you who have suggested an action
with more information. We know this time frame is tight but it is necessary for
us to meet Cabinet and OGP timelines.
Need help? This how_to_Suggest_an_Action_document_provides_some_tips. It’s an
easy process to navigate; it took me 10 minutes to add two suggestions of my
own this morning. Please get in touch if you’d like any support.
In my last update I mentioned I was going to Canberra to work with the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discuss themes and drafting on
the wiki. We grouped all actions provided to date into the following themes:
    * Engagement_for_OGP
    * Fiscal_Transparency
    * Fostering_Innovation
    * Freedom_of_Information
    * Government_Integrity
    * Open_Data
    * Public_Participation
    * Public_Service_Delivery
    * Resources_Management
We have added actions as discussion points so you can now comment on each
action suggested.
Toby and the Open Government team at PM&C have been discussing these themes
with agencies who could lead delivery of a commitment in that area. Many have
also expressed excitement about the actions suggested and several are keen to
get involved. PM&C are now working with these agencies to prepare them for the
11th April workshop.
***** Some questions that emerged during engagement last week *****
    * After the current awareness raising and crowd sourcing stage, what is the
      process for co-creating the National Action Plan going to look like?
    * How will the Government deal with actions that are suggested outside of
      the Grand Challenges?
    * What happened to the proposed teleconference?
    * How will we prioritise actions and turn them into 5-15 commitments?
Responses to your questions
Cocreation – The National Action Plan will be cocreated by those suggesting
actions, lead agencies and the Prime Minister and Cabinet Open Government team,
but whatever we suggest must be agreed to in Cabinet. The workshop in Canberra
will be where civil society and representatives from government agencies come
together. Everyone who suggests an action will be invited to attend. There can
only be 5-15 actions in the action plan. During the workshop agencies will host
theme based discussions to shape the OGP NAP commitment_templates with you.
Grand challenges – The Government has made it clear the two Grand Challenges
are their focus, but they are willing to consider other suggestions outside of
these areas. At the workshop we will develop commitments for all actions
suggested, or groups of actions as we prioritise and cluster them. Toby will
share more about Government’s position on this soon.
Teleconference –I will be emailing those of you who have suggested an action to
invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or 30th March so you can meet others
who have suggested actions within the same themes, to discuss similarities,
differences and priorities before the 11th April event.
Working together to prioritise actions – We need to work together to prioritise
suggestions if we are going to help Government narrow them down. I’d like to
help you / civil society / us, to start discussing that now before the workshop
on the 11th April. There are two ways you can get involved in this process:
    * Comment on actions on the wiki – I will start asking questions
      discussions about similarities, differences between actions and how they
      might be grouped or sequenced on the wiki and encourage your involvement.
    * In a theme based teleconference – I will be emailing those of you who
      have suggested an action to invite you to a teleconference on the 29th or
      30th March, to introduce you to others with similar suggestions, so we
      can discuss your ideas and priorities before the 11th April event.
***** Actions that you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Encouraging theme based engagement– I will be running teleconferences
      with those who have suggested actions under a theme. If you have
      suggested an action, you will receive a separate email from me about
      this.
    * Encouraging feedback from others on actions –actions have now been themed
      into groups with each posted as a discussion point on the wiki. We are
      looking for your thoughts about similarities, differences and
      opportunities to cluster actions so we can narrow down and prioritise
      with you at the workshop.
    * Connecting Australians to theworking_groupsand Open Government
      Partnership Support Unit,Regional Civil Society Coordinator Shreya Basu:
      shreya.basu@opengovpartnership.org
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – I am still pursing this with PM&C.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed. I have discussed my initial thoughts with the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Networks.
Thanks for reading my update. My next update will be after Easter, and will
include the runsheet proposed for the event on the 11th April.
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss your ideas and ways you might
be more involved.

Thank you to those if you who have suggested an action to date. 60 actions have
been suggested and I’m aware of a few more currently being drafted.
I have reached out to as many groups and individuals I can find with an
interest in Open_Government_Principles_or_the_OGP_Grand_Challenges so they can
help promote the project, convene discussions and suggest actions.
The OGPAU stakeholder list now includes 512 individuals or organisations. 218
people have registered for updates, which is a 28% increase since our January
update, and I have emailed everyone on the list to raise awareness about the
project and encourage engagement. I have personally discussed the project with
87 people, some who are working on actions to suggest more than once. I am sure
there are many more people and organisations across Australia who would be
interested in the project, so please do spread the word. I have developed a one
page_Introduction_to_the_OGPAUdocument and How_to_Suggest_an_Action_template
with_tips to support those willing to help with this process. I am also happy
to provide content for emails and newsletters for you share with your networks
– just let me know how I can help.
I have prioritised direct engagement with State Government, Local Government
Associations, and professional association, networks and organisations with
some interest in Open Government principles or the Grand Challenges. I have
been well received by teams delivering Open Government in QLD, NSW, VIC, SA,
ACT and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in
Tasmania and the Northern Territory so please do get in touch, or put me in
touch with anyone interested if you know anyone there.
I was planning a national teleconference for those wishing to workshop their
ideas around key themes but almost everyone I have engaged with to date has
said they would prefer to workshop actions within their own organisations and
networks for now. In response, I have sought out opportunities to engage with
existing networks and I am connecting people with similar interests to each
other directly. I have also prepared a list of organisations I have been
talking to, to share for transparency and so you are aware of and can contact
each other. I have contacted PM&C’s privacy team to confirm this approach
whether this requires your consent.
As an example, I have also connected several people interested in transparency
and open data for extractive industries, shared open government platforms and
ways to enable innovation within agencies and innovation with others who want
to help.
Three events will be held to engage with professionals working in public
participation industry across the country. I have been working with the
Australasian division International_Association_for_Public_Participation_(IAP2)
who sent out a newsletter to their network and invited members to express an
interest in an event. We are now hosting a teleconference on the 21st of March
and I will host a 30minute workshop at the Ark Community Engagement Conference
on the 22nd March. At both events we will discuss the public participation
suggestions already put forward and try to generate more suggestions for
actions to include in the National Action Plan. Collabforge has offered to do
the same with attendees of the Engage2Act conference in Melbourne and we are
also exploring whether there is enough interest in an event about collaboration
and Open Gov. Toby has been doing similar work, engaging with the Open Data
sector through a series of industry events this week in Canberra. See more in
the Actions you have inspired section of this post below.
I’ll also be inviting the Australian Open Government Network Partnership and
those who have suggested related actions to these events. If you haven’t
suggested an action or been in touch with me about your interests please do so,
so I can introduce you to others. I am also happy to attend your events and
workshop actions with you and others with aligned interests.
Next week I am heading to Canberra to discuss the actions suggested so far with
Prime Minister and Cabinet and how they might be presented in the next draft of
the Plan to go up on the wiki. If you haven’t already suggested an action
please do so asap, so we are aware of your interest in the project and PM&C can
discuss suggestions with agencies. One paragraph is fine for now. This How_to
Suggest_an_Actiondocument should help, or you could look at the wiki for ideas
to build upon. PM&C are engaging with agencies around these suggestions to
determine which of these they will work with you to workshop in April.
The rest of this post summarises actions into themes, and outlines the actions
you have inspired me to take through our engagements. Thanks to everyone who
has made time to add an action to the wiki, to those of you who have met with
or made time to talk to me about the project and others who may be interested.
I’m really enjoying learning more about Open Government in Australia. I thought
you might too, so I have also drafted this blog post about What_I_have_learned
about_Open_Gov_in_Australiawhich I will update as I continue to engage.
***** Key themes: what I’ve been hearing online and offline *****
My discussions and actions suggested so far relate to the following key themes:
    * Public Participation –increased input into both policy and agenda
      setting, online methods, civic education and training for staff
    * Government Integrity – procurement, political donations, anti-corruption,
      parliamentary openness
    * Freedom of Information – review of the act, role of the commissioners,
      privacy, copyright review
    * Fiscal Transparency – open budget, political donations
    * Public Service Delivery – how Gov work with community and industry, how
      citizens find services
    * Resources Management – sustainable development, working with indigenous
      communities, see also OpenData and Government Data for Access to
      Information and Transparency
    * Open Data – standardised formats, public register and open raw data,
      publishing practices for data and publications including natural resource
      and extractive industry data
    * Government Data for Access to Information and Transparency – extractive
      industry data and transparency initiative
    * Fostering innovation – enabling and delivering innovation within Gov
      given budget and procurement processes, open innovation models that
      deliver innovation outcomes rather than tender to deliver outputs,
      support small to medium size businesses to use open data and deliver
      services
    * Engagement for OGP – raising awareness now, engaging the States, forums
      for ongoing engagement, mentoring staff
You can see suggested actions in more details on theWIKI.
***** Actions you have inspired me to take *****
Based on your input to date I am now:
    * Supporting a number of organisations with development of their
      submissions
    * Connecting Australians with aligned ideas and complimentary skills – e.g.
      My Community Directory and Nook Studios to Code for Australia; and the
      author of the MOU for NSW Government’s shared platform to teams wanting
      to do the same thing in QLD and Victoria. Professionals working with data
      for natural resource management and sustainability programs. Individuals
      to the International OGP Working Groups.
    * Co-hosting events – I am working with IAP2 to host an event about public
      participation; Collabforge is going to host a discussion at Engage2Act in
      Melbourne and I am going to host a discussion at the Ark Conference for
      Community. Engagement. I have also offered to host events with a number
      of the organisations listed.
    * Preparing for a National OGPAU teleconference – will now be a
      teleconference using a tool that allows me to connect people with similar
      ideas
    * Connecting Australians to the OGP Working Groups
    * Researching similar actions outlined in Action Plans prepared by other
      countries
    * Investigating privacy and consent requirementsfor publishing stakeholder
      details – you may see an email from me asking if I can add your names to
      this blog posts in future and share my stakeholder list publicly.
    * Researching ongoing engagement forums being used in other Countries to
      engage stakeholders about Open Government Partnership after action plans
      are developed – I have spoken to the OGP civil society team, and some of
      the people involved in the NZ and the UK. Let me know if there are others
      you like.
    * Researching OGP NAP review reports to understand how Australia might be
      assessed and what actions should include.
Thanks for reading my update. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss
your ideas and ways you might be more involved.

I’ve really enjoyed meeting with the teams responsible for Open Government
initiatives inside Government across Australia.
I have talked at length or met with representatives from QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, ACT
and WA Government’s but I am still trying to find the best contacts in Tasmania
and the Northern Territory. Please get in touch, or put me in touch with anyone
interested if you know anyone there.
Below is a summary of what I have discovered about how Open Government is being
delivered in State Government and some of the initiatives being delivered
within Australia as part of the international and National Open Government
movement. I will add to this as I continue to engage.
    * Open Gov in Queensland:
          o Where to go for updates: http://advanceqld.initiatives.qld.gov.au/
          o Open Data portal: https://data.qld.gov.au/
          o Queensland Globe: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/support-
            tools-grants/services/mapping-data-imagery/queensland-globe/about
          o The Business Innovation and Improvement Network in Government
            (BiiG) is growing: http://biig.govnet.qld.gov.au/ (internal for QLD
            Gov staff)
    * Open Gov in NSW:
          o Where to go for updates: https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/main
          o ICT Strategy and Open Gov: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/ict/
          o Open Data portal: http://data.nsw.gov.au/
          o NSW Government Data Analytics Centre (DAC) have been working with
            data analysts from University of Technology to generate insights
            from Government data: https://www.finance.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-
            analytics-centre
          o Have your say: http://www.haveyoursay.nsw.gov.au/consultations/
            search
          o Service NSW have been coordinating service delivery across NSW:
            https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/
          o Establishment of the NSW Customer Dashboard – The NSW Customer
            Dashboard is a digital tool for government to measure and report on
            performance from a customer perspective. It promotes a culture of
            accountability by providing a single snapshot of real time data
            across NSW Government.
          o Publish open government plans to showcase open government
            initiatives
            NSW Government agencies will publish open government plans which
            report progress on implementing the principles of transparency,
            collaboration, participation and innovation.
          o Update of the NSW Government Social Media Policy to accelerate
            community engagement through social media channels. This policy
            contains guiding principles to support agencies to use social media
            in a way that is open, collaborative, responsible, reliable and
            appropriate. The policy will be updated in 2016 to ensure currency
            and include guidance on analytics and other tools.
          o Publish a forward release schedule for open data. Open data
            promotes a transparent and accountable government. To accelerate
            progress on open data, NSW government agencies will publish a
            forward release schedule of priority data. The forward release
            schedule will facilitate greater public interaction with government
            data.
          o Update the NSW Government Open Data Policy. This policy will be
            updated in 2016 to accelerate the release of data, and prioritise
            data released in more open formats. This_policy_was_released_on_26/
            4/16.
          o NSW Government have developed a platform to support Jury
            Management, which is now being used in two other Australian States
            through an Memorandum or Understanding, this sharing of services is
            now generating revenue for the NSW.
          o Open OEH – OEH is undertaking activities to assist staff in the
            proactive release of open data, increase public participation and
            collaborate with our partners for Open Government including:
                # A proactive release framework and supporting tools including
                  Data release guidelines.
                # An Open Data Portal – Due for release in early 2016 the Open
                  Data Portal is an extension of OEH’s long term commitment and
                  innovation in the area of information access. The Open Data
                  Portal will be able to automatically push metadata to
                  data.nsw.gov.au (NSW metadata portal), opengov.nsw.gov.au
                  (NSW publications portal) and ANDS.
                # Embedding Creative Commons licencing – Open OEH has
                  implemented the Ausgoal framework (Creative Commons
                  licencing) to the Open Data Portal (95% of datasets available
                  to the public), all public documents (post June 2015) and the
                  OEH website.
                # Increasing public participation – OEH are using online
                  methods to engage including applications like Nature Near
                  that allow users to add sites, and rate and share them
                  through social media.
                # Open Governance Framework – This framework will provide
                  drivers, policies, rules and tools for Open Government in
                  OEH. A pioneer program has also been developed to identify
                  and train key staff who can help determine barriers and
                  enablers for Open Government for the executive to consider.
                  Authorisation levels are also being reviewed to devolve
                  responsibilities to Managers, cut down internal red tape and
                  speed up approval for the release of open data.
                # Working closely with Councils to co-design and co-deliver
                  resource management programs such as the coastal reforms
                  project.

OGP engagement update – 1st March
by Amelia Loye engage2
It’s a great honour to be supporting the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet (PM&C) to engage civil society in Open Government.
I have had a wonderful couple of weeks engaging with people and organisations
across Australia to raise awareness about the project and encourage input into
our National Action Plan. There are some really amazing things happening across
our Country and each week I will share what I learn with you in this blog and
email update.
You have four more weeks to suggest an action for the National Action Plan on
Open Government. This new timeline and a draft engagement strategy are now live
on the website.
I realise I can’t reach everyone across Australia, so my plan is to continue
raising awareness and building the capability of stakeholders passionate about
the Open Government principles so they can convene conversations and collect
input. The strategy is a live document and I would welcome any other
suggestions you have for how I might encourage engagement in the development of
the Action Plan. You can reach me on phone 0411960585 or by email at
amelia@engage2.com.au.
Engaging your networks:I have been working with a range of different
stakeholders who are now promoting the Open Government Partnership through
their newsletters and at events. I am also working with stakeholders who want
to host events to workshop potential actions with their industry or networks.
If this sounds like you, but we have not been in touch, please give me a call
to discuss. You can also connect with others across the globe working on Open
Government actions in areas that interest you through the International Open
Government Working Groups.
Suggest an action and comment on the draft document: The document is being
drafted liveon_the_wiki so you can observe and comment on the content. If you
would like to discuss your action and workshop your suggestions please get in
touch with me directly. I’d love to work with you and connect you to others
with similar interests across the Country.
What’s happening with your input: I collate all input received and report back
weekly to PM&C. This includes discussions by phone and face-to-face meetings,
and comments made on blog posts and the wiki, and email submissions.
Last week at an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) meeting about the Open
Government Partnership, PM&C were asked by attendees to share a summary of your
input to date.
As I compile these reports I will also add key themes raised to the wiki so
there is one place for you to see all input to date. Formal submissions
received will also be published publicly on the website as they are received.
Thank you to those of you who have suggested actions to date. I look forward to
hearing from and working with many more of you over the coming weeks.

****** Submission_from_the_Australian_Open_Government_Network_(AOGPN) ******
Posted on February_3,_2016  by  Toby_Bellwood

This is a full reproduction of a submission received from the Australian Open
Government Network on February 2 2016.
===============================================================================
 
Australian Open Government network
I am writing on behalf of the Steering Committee of the Australian Open
Government Partnership Network (AOGPN).
The AOGPN was established in December 2015 as a coalition of individuals and
organisations for the purpose of engaging with government in the development of
Australia’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan and
participating in efforts to enhance and improve democratic practices in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.
The network will provide a forum for the exchange of information and ideas on
areas for reform, seek to ensure the action plan is developed in the true
spirit of partnership, and work to assist government in the determination of
priorities for consideration.
Current Steering Committee members are:
    * Dr David Solomon (Accountability Roundtable), Chair
    * Dr Nicholas Gruen (Open Knowlege Australia)
    * Jon Lawrence (Electronic Frontiers Australia)
    * Dr Johan Lidberg (School of Media, Arts and Journalism, Monash
      University)
    * Phil Newman (Transparency International Australia)
    * Kat Szuminska (OpenAustralia Foundation)
    * Craig Thomler (Gov 2.0 Advocate)
    * Peter Timmins, Convener
A number of other organisations and individuals have joined or are in the
process of doing so.
At the invitation of the OGP Support Unit, Kat Szuminska attended the Civil
Society Leaders Workshop in The Hague from 21-23 January.
The Network has a webpage at www.aogpn.net and will shortly have a more
comprehensive web presence, encouraging other organisations and individuals to
contribute to the second phase of the consultation now underway.
The following issues and concerns arise from what we have seen so far as the
government moves ahead on this important initiative.
Low key initiative
Given the importance of reform and the opportunity provided to improve how
government operates including through citizen engagement, the announcement of
Australia’s intention to proceed to membership is off to a low key start.
While December/January present problems for effective communication, the topic
and partnership element warrants more vigorous attempts to engage and encourage
participation from potentially interested stakeholder organisations and members
of the public.
While the government launched the OGPau website and funded four information
sessions in December, for an initiative supported by the Prime Minister and
entire Cabinet this has been a particularly low key start to what should be
substantial national engagement activity.
The Prime Minister has not issued media releases specifically related to the
OGP membership decision or the subsequent national consultation. There has been
no public media statements on the topic by the Prime Minister or any of his
Cabinet Ministers.
While the Prime Minister’s letter to the OGP Steering Committee Co-chairs
announcing the Australian Government’s commitment to OGP Membership is readily
available on the OGP’s website, it is not obvious on the website of the Prime
Minister, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or on the consultation
website.
As such the government appears to have done little to bring the initiative to
public attention.
Unfortunately, there has been virtually no mention of Australia’s OGP
membership process in mainstream media.
The four information sessions held in the pre Christmas period at short notice
were welcome but one meeting in each location, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and
Canberra appears to have had limited impact and does not constitute a national
campaign of engagement.
Australians who have closely followed the development and growth of the OGP in
recent years have located the Australian government’s consultation materials
published online. However these materials are not readily available to
interested parties who have not been informed of the process by the government.
In addition, locating and responding to the present consultation represents a
challenge even for those aware of the process.
While the OGPau website can be discovered by those aware of the process, there
is no obvious link to the Wiki, where the consultation process is largely
taking place.
It is the view of the Network that this low key approach to engagement puts at
risk Australia’s membership process. It substantially raises the probability of
Australia’s National Action Plan being rejected by the OGP on the grounds of
insufficient consultation, as was New Zealand’s initial OGP membership attempt.
General approach
It was unfortunate that the Government, with no prior consultation, announced
it had chosen two Grand Challenges from the OGP list that did not include
Public Integrity.
Issues related to anti-corruption are certain to arise during the course of
consultation. Australia dropped 10 positions in the recently published
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. While it is pleasing
to see in the published FAQs that nothing is off the table, this should have
been the starting position for consultation and public engagement.
The absence of a formal high level group within government to provide the
necessary leadership, direction, coordination and oversight of the OGP
initiative is a surprising omission from the published framework. So too is the
lack of a formal mechanism that would bring government and civil society
together at various decision points during the public consultation, decision
making and implementation phases of the National Action Plan. The OGP itself
with a mix of government and CSO members and government and CSO co-chairs
provides an exemplary model and there are examples from other OGP members that
Australia could emulate quickly and without disrupting the current process and
timeline.
The lack of a genuine consultation mechanism between government and civil
society is an issue that needs to be on the agenda for the meeting proposed for
the end of the OGP membership consultation phase in early March.
The Steering Committee echoes comments made by others that Australian states,
territories and local government must be part of the open government journey.
The OGP is encouraging the involvement of sub-national governments in open
government initiatives. While the National Action Plan should be the Australian
Government’s plan, states, territories and local government should be part of a
discussion and debate on issues that cut across all levels of government.
The continuing stand-off between the Government and the Senate over the future
of the Office of Australian Information Commissioner is a serious concern that
should be dealt with separately from the OGP membership process by withdrawal
of the bill and reinstatement of funding for all OAIC functions.
The government position that the office is to be abolished, removing a
cornerstone of the 2010 FOI reforms. flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s
proclamation of “Australia’s long proud tradition of open and transparent
government.”
As the inaugural Australian Information Commissioner, Professor John McMillan,
wrote recently, “The FOI Act is too important either to languish or to go
through periodic upheaval as it has for more than 30 years.”
Vision and Background
The Network may have more to add about the published Vision and Background
material.
At this stage we note that there is no mention in the published materials of
the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted unanimously at the UN
General Assembly last year, to the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption, or to Australia’s involvement in the work of the G20 on anti
corruption matters.
The OGP encourages support for the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Forty eight
governments have endorsed the declaration to date including Indonesia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. Australia should follow this lead.
Australia ratified UNCAC in 2005 but is yet to adopt an anti-corruption plan
required by the convention.
The Attorney general’s Department website
https://www.ag.gov.au/CrimeAndCorruption/AntiCorruption/Pages/
Globalleadershipincombatingcorruption.aspx makes much of Australia’s leadership
role in the development of the G20 2015-16 G20 Anti Corruption Plan.
The Plan states:
     “G20 countries commit to leading by example in ensuring our
     government agencies, policies, and officials implement international
     best practices for public sector transparency and integrity. The
     (Anti Corruption Working Group) has identified public procurement,
     open data, whistleblower protections, immunities for public
     officials, fiscal and budget transparency, and standards for public
     officials as issues which merit particular attention.”
The G20 Leaders Communique issued in Turkey in November 2015 further states:
     “16.In support of our growth and resilience agenda, we remain
     committed to building a global culture of intolerance towards
     corruption through effectively implementing the 2015-2016 G20 Anti-
     Corruption Action Plan. We endorse the G20 High-Level Principles on
     Integrity and Transparency in the Private Sector which will help our
     companies comply with global standards on ethics and anti-corruption.
     Ensuring the integrity and transparency of our public sectors is
     essential. In this regard, we endorse the G20 Anti-Corruption Open
     Data Principles and the G20 Principles for Promoting Integrity in
     Public Procurement, and we welcome the ongoing work on asset
     disclosure frameworks…”
The Agreed Documents that accompany the Communique include G20 High-Level
Principles on Private Sector Transparency and Integrity; G20 Principles for
Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement and G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data
Principles.
Next steps
We look forward to ongoing dialogue with the Australian Government as the
consultation proceeds.

website.

Happy New Year! We hope you all had a safe and enjoyable holiday period. Our
team took a short break to recoup and have now well and truly started 2016 by
making significant headway on a number of priorities.
This week the Department engaged Amelia Loye from engage2 to assist us in
designing and delivering the public and Civil Society engagement throughout
Stage 2 (drafting and live events) and Stage 3 (Community Prioritisation and
Workshop).  Amelia is currently looking at strategies to enhance our engagement
processes and will regularly keep those of you interested updated via the blog
and mailing list.
The blog comments and input gathered at the information sessions held late last
year have helped inform the draft National Action Plan, and we have set up a
live wiki so you can watch and get involved in its drafting. We will keep all
stakeholders informed about the ongoing development of the Plan, and
opportunities to get more involved.
One of our first tasks is to finalise details for the Stage 2 event at the end
of February.  We will have more information on this very shortly.
We will continue to work ensuring key stakeholders across the Australian
Government are involved, and they will be encouraged to participate alongside
Civil Society in this process.
At this stage we would encourage individuals and organisations to connect with
the Open Government Partnership working groups to contribute to peer exchange
and learning across the partnership. Key areas include:
    * Fiscal Openness,
    * Legislative Openness,
    * Access to Information,
    * Open Data and
    * Openness in Natural Resources
More information is available at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/who-we-are/
ogp-working-groups
If you have ideas you think we can implement please comment on our blog, send
us an email to ogp@pmc.gov.au.  We’re looking for measureable actions that the
Australian Government can deliver and report against.
You can also help us develop the action plan through our wiki at https://
ogpau.wikispaces.com .

I would like to thank  all of the participants that joined us at the Open
Government Partnership citizen information sessions held in Brisbane, Sydney,
Canberra and Melbourne last week.  Your participation, enthusiasm and
contribution to the development of the Australian Government’s National Action
Plan (the Plan) is greatly appreciated.
As a result of the discussions at these face to face information sessions, we
have created an email address (ogp@pmc.gov.au) as an additional communication
and feedback mechanism for any people or organisations who feel less
comfortable contributing to the open sessions or with using the wikispaces.
 Please feel free to submit your suggestions to us via this address and you can
be assured that, at no time, will a single contribution, suggestion or feedback
be directly attributed to a person or an organisation.
Additionally, there is now a section on the website where we will be
progressively adding answers to frequently asked questions (where we are able
to provide them) about the ongoing development of the Plan (https://
ogpau.govspace.gov.au/faqs/).
As we enter the second stage of the consultation process, we would encourage
all participants to consider their ideas and begin drafting their suggestions. 
Suggestions should meet one or more of the OGP principles of: Transparency;
Accountability; Participation; Technology; and/or Innovation.  Submissions
should also consider implementation options and potential ways that progress
can be measured.
There are a wealth of resources located at http://www.opengovpartnership.org/
explorer/landing which provide details of the existing commitments developed by
other countries in their National Action Plans, as well as a list of Plans that
have been through the OGP Independent Review Mechanism. Please see the bottom
of this email for more information on how to contribute.
***** Updates from the coordination team *****
As Pia mentioned in her pre-recorded address to the live events, she will be
finishing work after the Christmas break to commence maternity leave.  As a
result, I have asked Toby Bellwood  to take on the role of National Action Plan
Coordinator.  Toby will lead the consultation process over the course of the
next 6 months.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Pia for her
tireless dedication to the OGP process she will be greatly missed, but has
assured us that she will be keeping an eye from afar.
I am also currently recruiting a specialist position to help with the design
and delivery of the public consultation aspects of stage 2 (drafting and live
events) and Stage 3 (running the Community Prioritisation and Workshop).  Once
the outcome of this process is known, Toby will ensure to update everyone.
Please continue to submit ideas, raise questions, and keep in touch over the
coming weeks.  Whilst the team is taking a well-earned break between Christmas
and New Year, all the various channels (website, wiki, blog, twitter and email)
will still be open for contributions.  Toby will send out another email in
January updating you on the consultation process and providing more details on
the events planned for Stages 2 and 3.
