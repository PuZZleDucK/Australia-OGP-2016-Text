The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make
governments more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens.
To complete membership, the Australian Government will develop a
National Action Plan by the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP
timeline.

This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish
a vision for open government in Australia, defining the structure of the
Australian Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of
open government in Australia. The second stage of consultation will
focus on specific commitments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History** (17 November 2015 – 11
December 2015):

A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision,
skeleton framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the
background/history of open government in Australia. We also encourage
you to explore the [OGP website](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
including some of the [actions plans from other
governments](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries). This is
Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:

-   Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1
    and 2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks.
    You can also indicate your interest by joining the [OGPau mailing
    list](http://eepurl.com/bGaj0P) and ticking the information sessions
    option, and we’ll notify you when they are open for registration.
-   Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
-   Adding feedback to the draft [Background
    page](../background/index.html) comments.
-   Tweeting your thoughts to \#ogpau.
-   Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2
    as we need to get the framework right first.

See the [full consultation timeline](../national-action-plan/index.html)
on the National Action Plan Consultation page.

Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments
below for this stage. Please also find further information [About
OGP](../about-ogp/index.html)..

We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the
contributions of others.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the
most transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world.
However, there is always more that can be done. Please contribute your
thoughts in the comments below on what a future vision for open
government could look like in Australia. We will collate the input
into the wiki at the end of this stage.

A couple of example is provided to kick things off:

-   Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
    processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
-   Open government means citizens playing a greater part in
    policy development.

Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action
Plan. The [OGP National Action Plan
template](../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_actionplan_guide%20FINAL_0.pdf)
is available le online and a useful guide though most countries deviate
from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed are identical in
structure to the template. Please add your comments on this structure
below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will be
set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.

1.  **Introduction** – an overview of the Australian Government’s
    commitment, the grand challenges addressed in the NAP (*improved
    public services* and *more effectively managing public resources*)
2.  **Vision** – the vision for open government in Australia, looking
    forward
3.  **NAP Development Process** – the process of developing the
    Australian Government National Action Plan
4.  **Open Government Efforts to Date** – background of open government
    in Australia
5.  **Overview of commitments** – an overview of the commitments, then
    broken down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to
    identify which grand challenge they support, and which principles
    they support (see [NAP page on ogpau
    website](../national-action-plan/index.html) for detail)
6.  **Conclusion** – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be
    supported

Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.

    <span class="fn">[National Archives of
    Australia](http://www.naa.gov.au/){.url}</span> on [January 8, 2016

    <div class="comment-content">

    This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the
    National Archives). The National Archives was established by the
    Archives Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian
    Government, although it has existed in various forms since
    the 1940s. The National Archives is the lead agency for ensuring
    transparency and accountability in government through its legislated
    role of setting records and information management requirements for
    Australian Government agencies, and preserving and providing a
    public right of access to government information.

    Open government increases the transparency and accountability of
    government, encourages greater public engagement, strengthens
    governance and improves public service delivery. The National
    Archives plays a key role in open government by promoting the
    creation, management and preservation of authentic, reliable and
    usable Commonwealth information, and facilitating access to
    this information.

    The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and
    effectively covers all information created, used or received in the
    course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth)
    (Archives Act), the National Archives:\
    • identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;\
    • preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth
    accessible;\
    • oversees Commonwealth records management;\
    • determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies;
    and\
    • imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of
    Commonwealth records.

    Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the
    transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of
    successive governments, and is integral to a successful open
    government policy. It is from this perspective and with this
    legislated role that the National Archives provides the following
    observations and comments on the Vision and the framework for the
    National Action Plan.

    Vision\
    The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved
    management of, and accessibility to, information and records. A key
    element of this is a move to fully digital information management
    and business processes across the Australian government sector. This
    aligns with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans
    of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It also aligns
    with the example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in
    the 21st century needs to translate to digital processes and
    reporting to improve transparency and accountability’. This has
    already been achieved by a number of initiatives which the National
    Archives is currently leading including earlier access to government
    records, the Digital Continuity 2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution
    to manage digital government information, and modernisation of the
    Archives Act.

    The National Archives also recommends that the Vision and Plan
    recognise Australia’s strong open government history, culture,
    initiatives and policies already in existence, including the
    Archives Act, to demonstrate Australia as a leading example of open
    government well before the Open Government Partnership came
    into being.

    The government also recognises through legislation such as the
    Archives Act 1983, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the
    Privacy Act 1988 the need to restrict the circulation of some
    information for a particular time in order to protect the defence
    and security of the nation, its relationship with the world, and the
    privacy of citizens. The Archives Act entrusts the National Archives
    with this role in relation to government information and provides
    for the exemption from public release of a number of categories of
    information including national security, defence, international
    relations, confidential information, and personal affairs. When
    sensitivities lapse, information that was formerly withheld can be
    made available for access. The balance between the need to protect
    information from unauthorised use or accidental release, and open
    government principles should be considered in development of
    the Vision.

    The Australian Government’s policy of open government is well
    established, and it is therefore well positioned to contribute to
    the Open Government Partnership and the National Action Plan. It
    will also be well positioned to target areas that require more
    effort to continue to advance open government in Australia. The
    National Archives has, and will continue to, play a key role in
    supporting open government initiatives by carrying out its core
    functions and by effectively contributing to Australia’s National
    Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership.

    Framework\
    The National Archives supports the general framework outlined in the
    Australian Government National Action Plan template, and recommends
    a clear and strong statement of Open Government achievements to date
    from both a contemporary and historical context. We would
    particularly like to note Australia as one of the most open archival
    and government information access regimes in the world through the
    management, preservation and provision of access to government
    information under the Archives Act.

    Established by the Act, one of the National Archives’ key roles is
    enabling public access to the archival resources of the nation.
    Through this role, the Archives has played a lead in open government
    and ensuring that citizens have access to the decisions and actions
    of their government, thereby supporting the rights and entitlements
    of individuals and promoting accountability and transparency.

    <div class="comment-content">

    I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
    membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational
    principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making.
    This is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs
    where those the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the
    decisions on the design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.\
    However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining
    membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session
    in four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately
    disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of
    civil society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted
    most by this approach to ‘engagement’

        Thanks for the feedback Nigel, we have been speaking to a few
        people about how to broaden the scope and be more inclusive and
        we are putting together a strategy for broad outreach to begin
        in January. If you have any specific suggestions about groups to
        include, we would appreciate your (and everyone’s) help with
        making this as open and inclusive as possible.

    \[Pia Waugh\] The following comment was contributed via email from
    Tim Smith of the Accountability Round Table and is published here
    with permission, along with a link to the longer submission sent.

    \[Tim Smith\] I Chair the Accountability Round Table
    (<http://www.accountabilityrt.org/>). Its aims and objectives mirror
    those of the Open Government Partnership. It came into existence in
    2006 and, since then, has been seeking to achieve those aims and
    objectives at the Commonwealth and State levels.

    The Government should be congratulated in recently confirming its
    commitment to the OGP and embarking upon the preparation of the
    National Action Plan. The Australian community has been provided
    with a unique and very significant opportunity to reform our
    Commonwealth Parliamentary democracy, and indirectly those of the
    States and Territories, by addressing, in partnership with the
    Government, the serious weaknesses and problems that have developed
    in our that Democracy. It has the potential to be the most important
    development in Australia’s Democracies since Federation. Whether
    that is realised will depend, in large measure, on the Australian
    Community’s response within this new Partnership.

    ART has made a submission to the Government addressing the matters
    raised in this first stage (Link to submission). In it, ART submits
    that it will be critical for the successful formulation of
    Australia’s NAP, that the Partnership, from the outset address
    the following.

    1\. Identify what should guide this Partnership enterprise. This includes
    –\
    • the Objectives of the OGP and its Mission Statement,\
    • the nature and purposes of parliamentary democracies and\
    • a fundamental but long forgotten ethical and common-law principle –
    that public office is a public trust and that those holding public
    office are under a fiduciary obligation when exercising their powers
    entrusted to them to place the public interest first and ahead of their
    own interests and other private interests.

    ART submits that all people who participate in this Partnership
    enterprise, should be guided by these matters and principles.

    We also submit that the absence of the public office public trust
    principle from our Australian consciousness for many years has been
    a major factor in the problems that now exist in our Commonwealth
    Democracy;

    2\. Accurately and completely establish not only the past history of our
    Commonwealth democracy but also its current reality, good and bad. We
    submit that significantly more work is needed to complete this task — in
    respect of both the good and the bad.

    Applying the above objectives and principles to the actual
    realities, past and present, the Partnership can proceed with
    reasonable confidence in choosing, in the public interest, the\
    • OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that should be selected and\
    • the commitments that should be given priority in the NAP.

    The Partnership can also articulate its Vision and fine tune the
    proposed Framework for the development of the NAP.

    The Submission discusses these issues, the relevant evidence and the
    choices of the OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that will best
    serve the public interest in the Commonwealth of Australia.

    We hope that it will be found helpful in each stage of this
    historic exercise.

    TIA congratulates the Australian Government and Prime Minister
    Turnbull for the recent decision to commit to finalizing Australia’s
    membership of the OGP, and for the proactive approach it is taking
    to public consultation in the development of the first Australian
    Government National Action Plan.

    The OGP requires broad consultation in the development of the NAP –
    from the public, civil society and the private sector. TIA’s
    comments come from its perspective as the leading civil society
    organization promoting transparency, integrity and accountability,
    and fighting corruption.

    Introduction

    Now that it has decided to commit to finalizing its membership of
    the OGP, the government is moving with commendable speed to draft
    its first National Action Plan by May 2016, for government
    consideration in June 2016, and a launch in July 2016. This speed
    does bring risks – that the first National Action Plan is
    essentially a ‘goodwill’ document, not ambitious enough and not
    containing commitments of substance. The second risk is that to meet
    these tight timelines the consultation process will be structured in
    a way which downplays the opportunity for real input from civil
    society and other non-government sectors. The Government and its
    advisers may take the view that it is better to have a first NAP,
    however imperfect, and that the NAP process and content will be much
    more satisfactory the second time around. TIA’s job, and that of
    civil society generally, is to participate as fully as possible in
    the development of a first NAP which is ambitious in scope and
    commitment, and flags priority areas for future NAPs. TIA is
    committed to membership of the Australian Open Government
    Partnership Network recently constituted

    The remainder of this short paper flags some initial comments and
    areas of interest to TIA.

    Increasing Public Integrity

    The OGP – Australia website has already indicated that the first
    National Action Plan will focus on two of the OGP’s five ‘grand
    challenges’: Improving Public Services, and More Effectively
    Managing Public Resources. This decision was made without public
    consultation on whether other ‘grand challenges’ should have greater
    priority, especially Increasing Public Integrity (‘measures that
    address corruption and public ethics, access to information,
    campaign finance reform, and media and civil society freedom’).
    Successive Australian Governments have made considerable and
    sustained progress in improving public services and more effectively
    managing public resources, whereas limited and patchy progress has
    been made in the areas of corruption and public ethics, access to
    information, and campaign finance reform. In other words, there is
    much more to do in relation to increasing public integrity. TIA
    recommends that the Government include Increasing Public Integrity
    as one of its initial ‘grand challenges’.

    Identification of specific measures in the Australian NAP

    Many of the potential transparency gains from the OGP are
    cross-cutting issues that affect integrity in other sectors, other
    nations and multiple levels of government. In several countries,
    including the UK, ‘open government’ has been used to identify and
    implement crucial transparency and accountability measures such as
    the establishment of registers of beneficial ownership of companies,
    lifting the veil on opaque shell companies that the corrupt use to
    hold and transfer their illicit gains, implementing the Extractive
    Industries Transparency Initiative or developing comprehensive
    national anti-corruption agencies or comprehensive national
    anti-corruption action plans.

    TIA recommends that the Australian Government demonstrate its full
    commitment to participation in the Open Government Partnership, by
    undertaking to use open government reforms to meet the challenge of
    increasing public integrity in its national action plan, as an
    important element in increasing transparency and lowering corruption
    in Australia – and in particular by implementing the Extractive
    Industries Transparency Initiative, ensuring greater transparency in
    public procurement, and committing to a public register of corporate
    beneficial owners.

    Right to Information

    In 2014 the Federal Government withdrew funding and introduced
    legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information
    Commissioner (OAIC) and to reassign its functions to other
    government agencies and departments. The legislation has failed to
    pass the Parliament, and is unlikely to do so in the foreseeable
    future, leaving the OAIC ‘in limbo’ and the national FOI, privacy
    and information policy regimes in jeopardy. Abolition of the OAIC
    and dispersal of its strategic and operational functions between
    existing agencies and departments risks fragmentation of access to
    information rights and tools, which have historically been crucial
    in preventing and exposing corruption.\
    TIA recommends that as part of its development of the draft National
    Action Plan the Australian Government should renew its full support
    for a strong access to information regime by withdrawing legislation
    to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner,
    re-instating funding for the OAIC to fulfill its mandate in relation
    to freedom of information, privacy, and information policy, and
    ensuring the prompt appointment of a new Australian Information
    Commissioner with full powers, located in the Department of the
    Prime Minister and Cabinet.

    Multi-stakeholder oversight group

    Experience in developing OGP National Action Plans elsewhere
    suggests an advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance and add
    value to the partnership. The role of civil society in Australia’s
    OGP is critical, not just to ensure Australia’s OGP membership, but
    because the initiative is chaired equally between government and
    civil society in each country.

    The proposed consultation process for the development of Australia’s
    first NAP is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not provide
    for effective joint civil society and government input into, and
    oversight of, the development of the first NAP. Providing
    opportunities for feedback and comment is not a substitute for
    participation in finalising a draft NAP for
    government consideration. TIA therefore recommends that at least one
    civil society representative is invited to join the group of
    officials charged with finalising the draft NAP for
    government consideration.

    In the longer term, TIA recommends the establishment of a
    multi-stakeholder oversight group, comprising government, civil
    society, the private sector and the communications sector, to ensure
    ongoing commitment to fulfilling OGP obligations.

    TIA affirms the need to involve a range of departments and agencies
    across Government. An example of where such interdepartmental
    engagement would be beneficial would be necessary and beneficial is
    ensuring a link between the OPG process and the fulfillment of
    Australia’s commitment to develop a plan to implement the
    Sustainable Development Goals. That process should also be
    multi-stakeholder involving government civil society and the
    private sector.

    Great news that the government is moving in this direction and we
    look forward to progressing this issue together.

    However, I must agree with Peter that the selection of the Grand
    Challenges without any consultation is an issue and somewhat
    contrary to the spirit of the OGP. It could be argued the the
    current two Grand Challenges do not sufficiently address
    transparency or corruption, especially when one considers that the
    OGP’s self-description prioritises transparency, corruption AND
    governance, (“… a multilateral initiative that aims to secure
    concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency,
    empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to
    strengthen governance.”)

    It was heartening to see mention made of natural resources – this is
    an area that Australia could specialise in and contribute to the
    global movement. With Working Groups on this issue just being
    established in the global OGP movement, it would be great if we
    could push the envelope.

    This looks like a good consultation process Pia and Co. It is clear
    what will happen next and how we might get involved, it’s been well
    promoted (but I am actively tuned in), there is sufficient time for
    those interested to consider information presented, there are
    multiple methods (and points in the process) to provide input and
    for Gov to consolidate, respond to and consider it.\
    I hope we will also see good use of citizen engagement, technology
    and data to understand social issues / community needs and refining
    service delivery; and support the potential in our community to
    manage public resources. I would also like to see public
    participation in the way we deliver, report and monitor delivery of
    this National Action Plan – not just public reporting.

    Vision\
    There is not much in the way of a vision in the published material.

    Perhaps we couldn’t do much better than draw on the Open Government
    Declaration thus:

    “The Australian Government with input from its citizens is committed
    to improved democratic practices in line with the OGP Open
    Government Declaration:\
    •“to promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and
    harness the power of new technologies to make government more
    effective and accountable.”\
    •“to uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to
    improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and
    create safer communities”\
    •“to embrace principles of transparency and open government with a
    view toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human
    dignity in our own countries and in an increasingly interconnected
    world.”

    Grand Challenges\
    It is disappointing that the published material in parts suggests
    important decisions about ‘grand challenges’ that may limit
    commitments the government is prepared to consider have been made
    without any consultation.

    For example these statements:\
    “through consultation, the aim is for the first Australian
    Government’s National Action Plan to include ambitious actions that
    support the OGP grand challenges of improving public services and
    better managing public resources… Contributions for the NAP will be
    considered in the context of what will improve public services and
    improve management of public resources, as well as what will benefit
    the public, provide opportunities for business and support
    innovation in Australia.”

    However another sentence brings transparency and accountability and
    public engagement into the picture:\
    “Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve
    public service delivery, increase the transparency and
    accountability of government, and encourage greater
    public engagement. It also an opportunity for the public, civil
    society, and the private sector to contribute ideas for how
    government can achieve those goals.”

    Unilateral decisions about the scope of what will be considered
    would be an unfortunate start to a “partnership.”

    Consultation should commence and proceed on the basis of OGP
    guidance that the plan in its final form should “consist of a set of
    commitments that advance transparency, accountability, participation
    and/or technological innovation.”\
    <http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/develop-a-national-action-plan>

    Within that broad framework nothing should be ruled out before
    consultation starts.\
    As the process moves toward finality there should be no difficulty
    in grouping agreed commitments in a way that addresses one or more
    of the ‘challenges’, the only OGP requirement.

    Framework\
    According to the published material:\
    “The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead
    Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP
    and will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work.
    PM&C will work with other agencies across the Australian Public
    Service and other jurisdictions within Australia to develop the
    NAP….”

    Given the wide range of issues likely to arise, consideration should
    be given to establishing formal inter-departmental,
    inter-governmental and government-civil society mechanisms to play a
    part at various stages during the development of proposals, the
    determination of priorities and action taken to
    implement commitments.

    OGP related issues should not be considered in isolation.

    For example during the period ahead the government will develop
    plans to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.\
    <http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/>

    An OGP initiative encourages member countries to link both by
    signing the Joint Declaration on Open Government for the
    Implementation of the 2013 Agenda for Sustainable Development\
    [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP\_declaration.pdf](../../www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_declaration.pdf)

    Goal 16 and a number of the related targets are particularly
    relevant in the context of the development of Australia’s national
    action plan.\
    Goal16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable
    development, provide access to justice for all and build effective,
    accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”

    SDG targets for this goal include:\
    Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and
    ensure equal access to justice for all;\
    Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms;\
    Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all
    levels;\
    Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative
    decision-making at all levels;\
    Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in
    the institutions of global governance;\
    Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental
    freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and
    international agreements.

    Australia should sign the Declaration.

    The Government should establish a formal mechanism that ensures
    co-ordinated consideration of OGP, SDG and related strategic
    policy challenges. A high level inter agency group would assist
    this process.

    If ‘other jurisdictions’ are to be part of the framework (the OGP is
    talking of sub-national and city engagement) that too may require a
    formal mechanism to bring state, territory, city and local
    government along.

    And a joint government stakeholder group or forum to guide the
    partnership process and final decisions on the plan would give
    proper recognition to the fact that OGP decisions require joint
    ownership befitting a partnership.
