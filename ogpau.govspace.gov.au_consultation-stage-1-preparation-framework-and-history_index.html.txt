****** Consultation Stage 1: Preparation, Framework and History ******
Posted on November_17,_2015  by  Pia_Waugh
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global effort to make governments
more open and responsive to the changing needs of citizens. To complete
membership, the Australian Government will develop a National Action Plan by
the end of June 2016 to align with the OGP timeline.
This first stage of the public consultation will aim to establish a vision for
open government in Australia, defining the structure of the Australian
Government National Action Plan and sharing the history of open government in
Australia. The second stage of consultation will focus on specific commitments.

***** How to contribute to this stage of the National Action Plan development
*****
Stage 1 – Preparation, Framework and History (17 November 2015 – 11 December
2015):
A very short preparatory stage to get your feedback on a vision, skeleton
framework for the Australian NAP Draft and get feedback on the background/
history of open government in Australia. We also encourage you to explore
the OGP_website including some of the actions_plans_from_other_governments.
This is Australia’s first action plan. You can contribute to this stage by:
    * Some live streamed information sessions will be run during stages 1 and
      2. Details will be published on this blog in the coming weeks. You can
      also indicate your interest by joining the OGPau_mailing_list and ticking
      the information sessions option, and we’ll notify you when they are open
      for registration.
    * Adding feedback on the vision and framework to the comments below.
    * Adding feedback to the draft Background_page comments.
    * Tweeting your thoughts to #ogpau.
    * Please keep specific ideas, actions and contributions to stage 2 as we
      need to get the framework right first.
See the full_consultation_timeline on the National Action Plan
Consultation page.
Please primarily provide your contributions and feedback in the comments below
for this stage. Please also find further information About_OGP..
We look forward to your contributions and your feedback on the contributions of
others.

***** Building a Vision for Open Government in Australia *****
Australia has a long and proud history of open government, as one of the most
transparent, accountable and engaged democracies in the world. However, there
is always more that can be done. Please contribute your thoughts in the
comments below on what a future vision for open government could look like in
Australia. We will collate the input into the wiki at the end of this stage.
A couple of example is provided to kick things off:
    * Open government in the 21st century needs to translate to digital
      processes and reporting to improve transparency and accountability.
    * Open government means citizens playing a greater part in policy
      development.
***** Building a Framework for the Australian Government National Action Plan
*****
Below is a basic skeleton for an Australian Government National Action Plan.
The OGP_National_Action_Plan_template is available le online and a useful guide
though most countries deviate from the guide slightly. No NAPs we have reviewed
are identical in structure to the template. Please add your comments on this
structure below and let us know what you think. After this stage the wiki will
be set up to reflect the skeleton document for detailed input and
contributions.
   1. Introduction – an overview of the Australian Government’s commitment, the
      grand challenges addressed in the NAP (improved public services and more
      effectively managing public resources)
   2. Vision – the vision for open government in Australia, looking forward
   3. NAP Development Process – the process of developing the Australian
      Government National Action Plan
   4. Open Government Efforts to Date – background of open government in
      Australia
   5. Overview of commitments – an overview of the commitments, then broken
      down into individual detail. Each commitment will need to identify which
      grand challenge they support, and which principles they support (see NAP
      page_on_ogpau_website for detail)
   6. Conclusion – wrapup of the NAP and how the commitments will be supported
Comments welcome below or direct contributions above.
***** Efforts to date – a background of open government in Australia *****

      National_Archives_of_Australia on January_8,_2016_at_9:07_am said:
      This comment is provided by the National Archives of Australia (the
      National Archives). The National Archives was established by the Archives
      Act 1983 as an executive agency of the Australian Government, although it
      has existed in various forms since the 1940s. The National Archives is
      the lead agency for ensuring transparency and accountability in
      government through its legislated role of setting records and information
      management requirements for Australian Government agencies, and
      preserving and providing a public right of access to government
      information.
      Open government increases the transparency and accountability of
      government, encourages greater public engagement, strengthens governance
      and improves public service delivery. The National Archives plays a key
      role in open government by promoting the creation, management and
      preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth information,
      and facilitating access to this information.
      The Archives Act 1983 provides a broad definition of records and
      effectively covers all information created, used or received in the
      course of Commonwealth business. Under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth)
      (Archives Act), the National Archives:
      • identifies the archival resources of the Commonwealth;
      • preserves and makes the archival resources of the Commonwealth
      accessible;
      • oversees Commonwealth records management;
      • determines standards and provides advice to Commonwealth agencies; and
      • imposes recordkeeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records.
      Ready access to this information is vital for maintaining the
      transparency of the democratic process and the accountability of
      successive governments, and is integral to a successful open government
      policy. It is from this perspective and with this legislated role that
      the National Archives provides the following observations and comments on
      the Vision and the framework for the National Action Plan.
      Vision
      The National Archives supports a Vision that commits to the improved
      management of, and accessibility to, information and records. A key
      element of this is a move to fully digital information management and
      business processes across the Australian government sector. This aligns
      with key commitments identified in the National Action Plans of the
      United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. It also aligns with the
      example Vision statement provided that ‘Open government in the 21st
      century needs to translate to digital processes and reporting to improve
      transparency and accountability’. This has already been achieved by a
      number of initiatives which the National Archives is currently leading
      including earlier access to government records, the Digital Continuity
      2020 Policy, an end-to-end solution to manage digital government
      information, and modernisation of the Archives Act.
      The National Archives also recommends that the Vision and Plan recognise
      Australia’s strong open government history, culture, initiatives and
      policies already in existence, including the Archives Act, to demonstrate
      Australia as a leading example of open government well before the Open
      Government Partnership came into being.
      The government also recognises through legislation such as the Archives
      Act 1983, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988
      the need to restrict the circulation of some information for a particular
      time in order to protect the defence and security of the nation, its
      relationship with the world, and the privacy of citizens. The Archives
      Act entrusts the National Archives with this role in relation to
      government information and provides for the exemption from public release
      of a number of categories of information including national security,
      defence, international relations, confidential information, and personal
      affairs. When sensitivities lapse, information that was formerly withheld
      can be made available for access. The balance between the need to protect
      information from unauthorised use or accidental release, and open
      government principles should be considered in development of the Vision.
      The Australian Government’s policy of open government is well
      established, and it is therefore well positioned to contribute to the
      Open Government Partnership and the National Action Plan. It will also be
      well positioned to target areas that require more effort to continue to
      advance open government in Australia. The National Archives has, and will
      continue to, play a key role in supporting open government initiatives by
      carrying out its core functions and by effectively contributing to
      Australia’s National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership.
      Framework
      The National Archives supports the general framework outlined in the
      Australian Government National Action Plan template, and recommends a
      clear and strong statement of Open Government achievements to date from
      both a contemporary and historical context. We would particularly like to
      note Australia as one of the most open archival and government
      information access regimes in the world through the management,
      preservation and provision of access to government information under the
      Archives Act.
      Established by the Act, one of the National Archives’ key roles is
      enabling public access to the archival resources of the nation. Through
      this role, the Archives has played a lead in open government and ensuring
      that citizens have access to the decisions and actions of their
      government, thereby supporting the rights and entitlements of individuals
      and promoting accountability and transparency.

      I am encouraged that the Australian Government is progressing to
      membership of the OGP, particularly considering the foundational
      principle of engaging civil society in government decision-making. This
      is increasing being demonstrated in social purpose programs where those
      the programs are intended to impact are engaged in the decisions on the
      design, delivery and evaluation of those programs.
      However, I am surprised that the current engagement for gaining
      membership does not embody that very principle. Informations session in
      four major cities and limited consultation structures immediately
      disengages and potentailly loses the trust of many sectors of civil
      society. It is those most disadvantaged that will be impacted most by
      this approach to ‘engagement’

      [Pia Waugh] The following comment was contributed via email from Tim
      Smith of the Accountability Round Table and is published here with
      permission, along with a link to the longer submission sent.
      [Tim Smith] I Chair the Accountability Round Table (http://
      www.accountabilityrt.org/). Its aims and objectives mirror those of the
      Open Government Partnership. It came into existence in 2006 and, since
      then, has been seeking to achieve those aims and objectives at the
      Commonwealth and State levels.
      The Government should be congratulated in recently confirming its
      commitment to the OGP and embarking upon the preparation of the National
      Action Plan. The Australian community has been provided with a unique and
      very significant opportunity to reform our Commonwealth Parliamentary
      democracy, and indirectly those of the States and Territories, by
      addressing, in partnership with the Government, the serious weaknesses
      and problems that have developed in our that Democracy. It has the
      potential to be the most important development in Australia’s Democracies
      since Federation. Whether that is realised will depend, in large measure,
      on the Australian Community’s response within this new Partnership.
      ART has made a submission to the Government addressing the matters raised
      in this first stage (Link to submission). In it, ART submits that it will
      be critical for the successful formulation of Australia’s NAP, that the
      Partnership, from the outset address the following.
      1. Identify what should guide this Partnership enterprise. This includes
      –
      • the Objectives of the OGP and its Mission Statement,
      • the nature and purposes of parliamentary democracies and
      • a fundamental but long forgotten ethical and common-law principle –
      that public office is a public trust and that those holding public office
      are under a fiduciary obligation when exercising their powers entrusted
      to them to place the public interest first and ahead of their own
      interests and other private interests.
      ART submits that all people who participate in this Partnership
      enterprise, should be guided by these matters and principles.
      We also submit that the absence of the public office public trust
      principle from our Australian consciousness for many years has been a
      major factor in the problems that now exist in our Commonwealth
      Democracy;
      2. Accurately and completely establish not only the past history of our
      Commonwealth democracy but also its current reality, good and bad. We
      submit that significantly more work is needed to complete this task — in
      respect of both the good and the bad.
      Applying the above objectives and principles to the actual realities,
      past and present, the Partnership can proceed with reasonable confidence
      in choosing, in the public interest, the
      • OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that should be selected and
      • the commitments that should be given priority in the NAP.
      The Partnership can also articulate its Vision and fine tune the proposed
      Framework for the development of the NAP.
      The Submission discusses these issues, the relevant evidence and the
      choices of the OGP Grand Challenges and Principles that will best serve
      the public interest in the Commonwealth of Australia.
      We hope that it will be found helpful in each stage of this historic
      exercise.

      TIA congratulates the Australian Government and Prime Minister Turnbull
      for the recent decision to commit to finalizing Australia’s membership of
      the OGP, and for the proactive approach it is taking to public
      consultation in the development of the first Australian Government
      National Action Plan.
      The OGP requires broad consultation in the development of the NAP – from
      the public, civil society and the private sector. TIA’s comments come
      from its perspective as the leading civil society organization promoting
      transparency, integrity and accountability, and fighting corruption.
      Introduction
      Now that it has decided to commit to finalizing its membership of the
      OGP, the government is moving with commendable speed to draft its first
      National Action Plan by May 2016, for government consideration in June
      2016, and a launch in July 2016. This speed does bring risks – that the
      first National Action Plan is essentially a ‘goodwill’ document, not
      ambitious enough and not containing commitments of substance. The second
      risk is that to meet these tight timelines the consultation process will
      be structured in a way which downplays the opportunity for real input
      from civil society and other non-government sectors. The Government and
      its advisers may take the view that it is better to have a first NAP,
      however imperfect, and that the NAP process and content will be much more
      satisfactory the second time around. TIA’s job, and that of civil society
      generally, is to participate as fully as possible in the development of a
      first NAP which is ambitious in scope and commitment, and flags priority
      areas for future NAPs. TIA is committed to membership of the Australian
      Open Government Partnership Network recently constituted
      The remainder of this short paper flags some initial comments and areas
      of interest to TIA.
      Increasing Public Integrity
      The OGP – Australia website has already indicated that the first National
      Action Plan will focus on two of the OGP’s five ‘grand challenges’:
      Improving Public Services, and More Effectively Managing Public
      Resources. This decision was made without public consultation on whether
      other ‘grand challenges’ should have greater priority, especially
      Increasing Public Integrity (‘measures that address corruption and public
      ethics, access to information, campaign finance reform, and media and
      civil society freedom’). Successive Australian Governments have made
      considerable and sustained progress in improving public services and more
      effectively managing public resources, whereas limited and patchy
      progress has been made in the areas of corruption and public ethics,
      access to information, and campaign finance reform. In other words, there
      is much more to do in relation to increasing public integrity. TIA
      recommends that the Government include Increasing Public Integrity as one
      of its initial ‘grand challenges’.
      Identification of specific measures in the Australian NAP
      Many of the potential transparency gains from the OGP are cross-cutting
      issues that affect integrity in other sectors, other nations and multiple
      levels of government. In several countries, including the UK, ‘open
      government’ has been used to identify and implement crucial transparency
      and accountability measures such as the establishment of registers of
      beneficial ownership of companies, lifting the veil on opaque shell
      companies that the corrupt use to hold and transfer their illicit gains,
      implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative or
      developing comprehensive national anti-corruption agencies or
      comprehensive national anti-corruption action plans.
      TIA recommends that the Australian Government demonstrate its full
      commitment to participation in the Open Government Partnership, by
      undertaking to use open government reforms to meet the challenge of
      increasing public integrity in its national action plan, as an important
      element in increasing transparency and lowering corruption in Australia –
      and in particular by implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency
      Initiative, ensuring greater transparency in public procurement, and
      committing to a public register of corporate beneficial owners.
      Right to Information
      In 2014 the Federal Government withdrew funding and introduced
      legislation to abolish the Office of the Australian Information
      Commissioner (OAIC) and to reassign its functions to other government
      agencies and departments. The legislation has failed to pass the
      Parliament, and is unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future, leaving
      the OAIC ‘in limbo’ and the national FOI, privacy and information policy
      regimes in jeopardy. Abolition of the OAIC and dispersal of its strategic
      and operational functions between existing agencies and departments risks
      fragmentation of access to information rights and tools, which have
      historically been crucial in preventing and exposing corruption.
      TIA recommends that as part of its development of the draft National
      Action Plan the Australian Government should renew its full support for a
      strong access to information regime by withdrawing legislation to abolish
      the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, re-instating
      funding for the OAIC to fulfill its mandate in relation to freedom of
      information, privacy, and information policy, and ensuring the prompt
      appointment of a new Australian Information Commissioner with full
      powers, located in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
      Multi-stakeholder oversight group
      Experience in developing OGP National Action Plans elsewhere suggests an
      advisory body or stakeholder group can enhance and add value to the
      partnership. The role of civil society in Australia’s OGP is critical,
      not just to ensure Australia’s OGP membership, but because the initiative
      is chaired equally between government and civil society in each country.
      The proposed consultation process for the development of Australia’s
      first NAP is excellent as far as it goes, but it does not provide for
      effective joint civil society and government input into, and oversight
      of, the development of the first NAP. Providing opportunities for
      feedback and comment is not a substitute for participation in finalising
      a draft NAP for government consideration. TIA therefore recommends that
      at least one civil society representative is invited to join the group of
      officials charged with finalising the draft NAP for government
      consideration.
      In the longer term, TIA recommends the establishment of a multi-
      stakeholder oversight group, comprising government, civil society, the
      private sector and the communications sector, to ensure ongoing
      commitment to fulfilling OGP obligations.
      TIA affirms the need to involve a range of departments and agencies
      across Government. An example of where such interdepartmental engagement
      would be beneficial would be necessary and beneficial is ensuring a link
      between the OPG process and the fulfillment of Australia’s commitment to
      develop a plan to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. That
      process should also be multi-stakeholder involving government civil
      society and the private sector.

      Great news that the government is moving in this direction and we look
      forward to progressing this issue together.
      However, I must agree with Peter that the selection of the Grand
      Challenges without any consultation is an issue and somewhat contrary to
      the spirit of the OGP. It could be argued the the current two Grand
      Challenges do not sufficiently address transparency or corruption,
      especially when one considers that the OGP’s self-description prioritises
      transparency, corruption AND governance, (“… a multilateral initiative
      that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote
      transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new
      technologies to strengthen governance.”)
      It was heartening to see mention made of natural resources – this is an
      area that Australia could specialise in and contribute to the global
      movement. With Working Groups on this issue just being established in the
      global OGP movement, it would be great if we could push the envelope.

      This looks like a good consultation process Pia and Co. It is clear what
      will happen next and how we might get involved, it’s been well promoted
      (but I am actively tuned in), there is sufficient time for those
      interested to consider information presented, there are multiple methods
      (and points in the process) to provide input and for Gov to consolidate,
      respond to and consider it.
      I hope we will also see good use of citizen engagement, technology and
      data to understand social issues / community needs and refining service
      delivery; and support the potential in our community to manage public
      resources. I would also like to see public participation in the way we
      deliver, report and monitor delivery of this National Action Plan – not
      just public reporting.

      On the note about the framework, please do make the suggestion of such a
      collaborative structure as a commitment for consideration.

      Thanks Peter, all great input. We’ll try consolidate everything into the
      wiki to launch for Stage 2. It is worth noting in the spirit of a
      collaborative approach, we are asking you for your ideas about vision,
      not trying to impose one.
      Cheers,

      Vision
      There is not much in the way of a vision in the published material.
      Perhaps we couldn’t do much better than draw on the Open Government
      Declaration thus:
      “The Australian Government with input from its citizens is committed to
      improved democratic practices in line with the OGP Open Government
      Declaration:
      •“to promote transparency, fight corruption, empower citizens, and
      harness the power of new technologies to make government more effective
      and accountable.”
      •“to uphold the value of openness in our engagement with citizens to
      improve services, manage public resources, promote innovation, and create
      safer communities”
      •“to embrace principles of transparency and open government with a view
      toward achieving greater prosperity, well-being, and human dignity in our
      own countries and in an increasingly interconnected world.”
      Grand Challenges
      It is disappointing that the published material in parts suggests
      important decisions about ‘grand challenges’ that may limit commitments
      the government is prepared to consider have been made without any
      consultation.
      For example these statements:
      “through consultation, the aim is for the first Australian Government’s
      National Action Plan to include ambitious actions that support the OGP
      grand challenges of improving public services and better managing public
      resources… Contributions for the NAP will be considered in the context of
      what will improve public services and improve management of public
      resources, as well as what will benefit the public, provide opportunities
      for business and support innovation in Australia.”
      However another sentence brings transparency and accountability and
      public engagement into the picture:
      “Australia’s membership of the OGP is an opportunity to improve public
      service delivery, increase the transparency and accountability of
      government, and encourage greater public engagement. It also an
      opportunity for the public, civil society, and the private sector
      to contribute ideas for how government can achieve those goals.”
      Unilateral decisions about the scope of what will be considered would be
      an unfortunate start to a “partnership.”
      Consultation should commence and proceed on the basis of OGP guidance
      that the plan in its final form should “consist of a set of commitments
      that advance transparency, accountability, participation and/or
      technological innovation.”
      http://www.opengovpartnership.org/how-it-works/develop-a-national-action-
      plan
      Within that broad framework nothing should be ruled out before
      consultation starts.
      As the process moves toward finality there should be no difficulty in
      grouping agreed commitments in a way that addresses one or more of the
      ‘challenges’, the only OGP requirement.
      Framework
      According to the published material:
      “The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) is the lead
      Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s NAP and
      will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work. PM&C will
      work with other agencies across the Australian Public Service and other
      jurisdictions within Australia to develop the NAP….”
      Given the wide range of issues likely to arise, consideration should be
      given to establishing formal inter-departmental, inter-governmental and
      government-civil society mechanisms to play a part at various stages
      during the development of proposals, the determination of priorities and
      action taken to implement commitments.
      OGP related issues should not be considered in isolation.
      For example during the period ahead the government will develop plans to
      implement the Sustainable Development Goals.
      http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/
      An OGP initiative encourages member countries to link both by signing the
      Joint Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2013
      Agenda for Sustainable Development
      http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/
      OGP_declaration.pdf
      Goal 16 and a number of the related targets are particularly relevant in
      the context of the development of Australia’s national action plan.
      Goal16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable
      development, provide access to justice for all and build effective,
      accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”
      SDG targets for this goal include:
      Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and
      ensure equal access to justice for all;
      Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms;
      Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all
      levels;
      Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-
      making at all levels;
      Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the
      institutions of global governance;
      Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in
      accordance with national legislation and international agreements.
      Australia should sign the Declaration.
      The Government should establish a formal mechanism that ensures co-
      ordinated consideration of OGP, SDG and related strategic policy
      challenges. A high level inter agency group would assist this process.
      If ‘other jurisdictions’ are to be part of the framework (the OGP is
      talking of sub-national and city engagement) that too may require a
      formal mechanism to bring state, territory, city and local government
      along.
      And a joint government stakeholder group or forum to guide the
      partnership process and final decisions on the plan would give proper
      recognition to the fact that OGP decisions require joint ownership
      befitting a partnership.
